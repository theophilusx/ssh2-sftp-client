* Change Logging

** Version 6.0.1

   - Add additional utils tests to increase test coverage
   - Removed some dead code and unused utility functions to reduce download size
   - Cleanup tests and reduce inter-test dependencies

** V6.0.0.0
   - Update connection retry code to use the promise-retry module instead of
     plain rety module
   - Added optional filter argument for uploadDir/downlDir to select which files
     and directories are included
   - Added an optional boolean argument to delete to turn off raising an error
     when delete target does not exists
   - Reduced/simplified argument verification code to reduce package size and

   - bump Mocha version for tests

** v5.2.1
   - Move some dependencies into dev-Dependencies
** v5.2.0
   - Add new method posixRename() which uses the openSSH POSIX rename extension.
** v5.1.3
   - Fix bug when writing to root directory and failure due to not being able to
     determine parent
   - Refactor some tests to eliminate need to have artificial delays between
     tests
   - Bumped some dependency versions to latest version
** v5.1.2
   - Added back global close handler
   - Added dumpListeners() method

** v5.1.1
   - Added separate close handlers to each method.
   - Added missing return statement in connect method
   - Added additional troubleshooting documentation for
     common errors.

** v5.1.0
   - Fix bug in checkRemotePath() relating to handling of badly
     specified paths (issue #213)
   - Added additional debugging support
   - Add missing test for valid connection in end() method.
   - Bump ssh2 version to v0.8.8

** v5.0.2
   - Fix bugs related to win32 platform and local tests for valid directories
   - Fix problem with parsing of file paths

** v5.0.1
   - Turn down error checking to be less stringent and handle situations
     where user does not have read permission on parent directory.

** v5.0.0
   - Added two new methods ~uploadDir()~ and ~downloadDir()~
   - Removed deprecated ~auxList()~ method
   - Improved error message consistency
   - Added additional error checking to enable more accurate and useful error
     messages.
   - Added default error handler to deal with event errors which fire outside of
     active SftpClient methods (i.e. connection unexpectedly reset by remote host).
   - Modified event handlers to ensure that only event handlers added by the
     module are removed by the module (users now responsible for removing any
     custom event handlers they add).
   - Module error handlers added using ~prependListener~ to ensure they are
     called before any additional custom handlers added by client code.
   - Any error events fired during an ~end()~ call are now ignored.

** v4.3.1
   - Updated end() method to resolve once close event fires
   - Added errorListener to error event in each promise to catch error events
     and reject the promise. This should resolve the issue of some error events
     causing uncaughtException erros and causing the process to exit.

** v4.3.0
   - Ensure errors include an err.code property and pass through the error code
     from the originating error
   - Change tests for error type to use ~error.code~ instead of matching on
     ~error.message~.

   - Added exists() usage example to examples directory
   - Clarify documentation on get() method

   - Added additional examples in the ~example~ directory

** v4.2.1
   - Remove default close listener. changes in ssh2 API removed the utility of a
     default close listener
   - Fix path handling. Under mixed environments (where client platform and
     server platform were different i.e. one windows the other unix), path
     handling was broken due tot he use of path.join().
   - Ensure error messages include path details. Instead of errors such as "No
     such file" now report "No such file /path/to/missing/file" to help with
     debugging

** v4.2.0
   - Work-around for SSH2 =end= event bug
   - Added ability to set client name in constructor method
   - Added additional error checking to prevent ~connect()~ being called on
     already connected client
   - Added additional examples in =example= directory

     unable to read source
   - Expand tests for operations when lacking required permissions
   - Add additional data checks for ~append()~
     - Verify file exists
     - Verify file is writeable
     - Verify file is a regular file

   - Fix bug in mkdir() relating to handling of relative paths
   - Modify exists() to always return 'd' if path is '.'

   - Fix connection retry feature
   - sftp connection object set to null when 'end' signal is raised
   - Removed 'connectMethod' argument from connect method.
   - Refined adding/removing of listeners in connect() and end() methods to enable
     errors to be adequately caught and reported.
   - Deprecate auxList() and add pattern/regexp filter option to list()
   - Refactored handling of event signals to provide better feedback to clients
   - Removed pointless 'permissions' property from objects returned by ~stat()~
     (same as mode property). Added additional properties describing the type of
     object.
