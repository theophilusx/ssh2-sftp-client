#+TITLE: SSH2 SFTP Client

* Overview

an SFTP client for node.js, a wrapper around [[https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2][SSH2]]  which provides a high level
convenience abstraction as well as a Promise based API.

Documentation on the methods and available options in the underlying modules can
be found on the [[https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2][SSH2]] project pages.

Current stable release is *v9.0.4*.

Code has been tested against Node versions 14.20.0, 16.17.2 and 18.8.0

Node versions < 14.x are not supported. 

** Version 9.x Changes
  - Fix bug in ~connect()~ method when private key data was corrupted. The method was not
    handling errors fro corrupted ssh private keys and would hang indefinitely without
    reporting any error. Now reports that it was unable to parse the private key. 
  - Fix bug in ~end()~ method where it was possible for the module to attempt calling
    the underlying ssh2 ~end()~ method when ssh2 has not been initialised. This could
    lead to undefined reference errors.
  - Fix bug in ~get()~ method where supplied destination streams were not close, creating
    a possible resource leak. If the remote file did not exist, the method would return
    an error, but failed to close any passed in stream supplied as the destination for
    the data in the ~get()~ call.    
  - Change the default end and close handlers not to throw error or reject
    promises. Previously, an end or close event would cause an error to be raised or a
    promise to be rejected if the event was deemed to be /unexpected/. However,
    classification of events as being unexpected was unreliable and didn't add much real
    value. Both these handlers will now invalidate the SFTP connection object and log that
    the event fired and nothing else.
  - Changed when event handled flags are reset. Now they are reset after a new set of
    temporary listeners are added.
  - Don't throw an error when calling end() if there is no active SFTP connection. It does
    no harm to call end() when there is no connection, so no need to raise an error.
  - Use nullish coalescing when setting retry parameters instead of or'ing with
    defaults. Allows setting values to 0.  
  - *Breaking Change*: This version uses syntax not supported in node versions
    prior to v14. Therefore, node versions less than v14 will not work.
  - *Breaking Change*: This ~list()~ method no longer accepts a regular expression
    for filtering the entries to be returned. You can now specify a filter
    function instead. The function is called for each item in the list of items
    to be returned, passing in the item object as its only argument.
    Essentially, this is just a call to ~Array.filter()~, so the filter function
    should behave in the same way i.e. return true for items to be retained and
    false for those to be dropped.
  - *Breaking Change*: The ability to set ~autoClose~ on read and write streams and
    the ability to set ~end~ on ~pipe~ operations has been removed. These options
    caused confusion for users and were too easy to get wrong, plus it made the
    methods overly complicated. For those use-cases where you want to control
    streams at a low level, two new methods have been added, ~createReadStream()~ and
    ~createWriteStream()~. However, it should be noted that client code is 100%
    responsible for managing streams obtained using these methods. Use at your
    own risk!
  - *Breaking Change*: The 3rd argument to ~uploadDir()~ and ~downloadDir()~ methods
    has been change. Previously, the argument was a filter function used to
    select which directories and files to be transferred. The 3rd argument is
    now an options object with two supported properties, ~filter~ and ~useFastput~
    (for ~uploadDir()~) or ~useFastget~ (for ~downloadDir()~). If ~useFastput~ is true,
    the ~fastPut()~ method will be used to upload files. If ~false~ or missing, the
    slower, but better supported, ~put()~ method will be used. Likewise, the
    ~useFastget~ options can be set to ~true~ to use the ~fastGet()~ method for
    downloading files, otherwise the slower, but more reliable, ~get()~ method
    will be used.
  - The ~uploadDir()~ and ~downloadDir()~ methods now use asynchronous processes to
    upload/download files. This should result in improved performance for these
    two methods.
  - New Methods: Two new methods, ~createWriteStream()~ and ~createReadStream()~
    have been added. These methods will return a stream object connected to a
    remote file on the ~SFTP~ server. Client code is responsible for managing
    these stream objects. This includes adding any necessary event listeners and
    disposing of the objects once finished with them.
  - Re-factoring of Listeners: The library manages temporary listeners in order
    to provide a way to catch events and processes them inside a ~Promise~
    context. Previously, every method added its own set of temporary listeners.
    However, this could result in multiple sets of listeners being added,
    especially for methods which call other methods as part of their processing
    e.g. ~rmdir(),~ ~uploadDir()~ and ~dowqnloadDir()~. To avoid this, /internal only/
    versions of each method have been created. These internal methods use an
    /underscore/ ~_~ prefix. Client code should not use these methods directly. 
  - New method: Added ~rcopy()~ method to perform a remote copy of a file on the remote SFTP server. 
  - Bumped ssh2 version to 1.11.0

* Installation

#+begin_src shell
  npm install ssh2-sftp-client
#+end_src

* Basic Usage

#+begin_src javascript
  let Client = require('ssh2-sftp-client');
  let sftp = new Client();

  sftp.connect({
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: '8080',
    username: 'username',
    password: '******'
  }).then(() => {
    return sftp.list('/pathname');
  }).then(data => {
    console.log(data, 'the data info');
  }).catch(err => {
    console.log(err, 'catch error');
  });
#+end_src

* Documentation

The connection options are the same as those offered by the underlying SSH2
module. For full details, please see [[https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2#user-content-client-methods][SSH2 client methods]]

All the methods will return a Promise, except for ~on()~ and
~removeListener()~, which are typically only used in special use cases.

** Specifying Paths

   The convention with both FTP and SFTP is that paths are specified using a
   'nix' style i.e. use ~/~ as the path separator. This means that even if your
   SFTP server is running on a win32 platform, you should use ~/~ instead of ~\~
   as the path separator. For example, for a win32 path of ~C:\Users\fred~ you
   would actually use ~/C:/Users/fred~. If your win32 server does not support
   the 'nix' path convention, you can try setting the ~remotePathSep~ property
   of the ~SftpClient~ object to the path separator of your remote server. This
   *might* work, but has not been tested. Please let me know if you need to do
   this and provide details of the SFTP server so that I can try to create an
   appropriate environment and adjust things as necessary. At this point, I'm
   not aware of any win32 based SFTP servers which do not support the 'nix' path
   convention.

   All remote paths must either be absolute e.g. ~/absolute/path/to/file~ or
   they can be relative with a prefix of either ~./~ (relative to current remote
   directory) or ~../~ (relative to parent of current remote directory) e.g.
   ~./relative/path/to/file~ or ~../relative/to/parent/file~. It is also
   possible to do things like ~../../../file~ to specify the parent of the
   parent of the parent of the current remote directory. The shell tilde (~~~)
   and common environment variables like ~$HOME~ are NOT supported.

   It is important to recognise that the current remote directory may not always
   be what you may expect. A lot will depend on the remote platform of the SFTP
   server and how the SFTP server has been configured. When things don't seem to
   be working as expected, it is often a good idea to verify your assumptions
   regarding the remote directory and remote paths. One way to do this is to
   login using a command line program like ~sftp~ or ~lftp~.

   There is a small performance hit for using ~./~ and ~../~ as the module must
   query the remote server to determine what the root path is and derive the
   absolute path. Using absolute paths are therefore more efficient and likely
   more robust.

   When specifying file paths, ensure to include a full path i.e. include the
   remote file name. Don't expect the module to append the local file name to the
   path you provide. For example, the following will not work

   #+begin_src javascript
     client.put('/home/fred/test.txt', '/remote/dir');
   #+end_src

   will not result in the file ~test.txt~ being copied to
   ~/remote/dir/test.txt~. You need to specify the target file name as well e.g.

   #+begin_src javascript
     client.put('/home/fred/test.txt', '/remote/dir/test.txt');
   #+end_src

   Note that the remote file name does not have to be the same as the local file
   name. The following works fine;

   #+begin_src javascript
     client.put('/home/fred/test.txt', '/remote/dir/test-copy.txt');
   #+end_src

   This will copy the local file ~test.txt~ to the remote file ~test-copy.txt~
   in the directory ~/remote/dir~.

** Methods

*** new SftpClient(name) ===> SFTP client object

Constructor to create a new ~ssh2-sftp-client~ object. An optional ~name~ string
can be provided, which will be used in error messages to help identify which
client has thrown the error.

**** Constructor Arguments

- name :: string. An optional name string used in error messages

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  'use strict';

  const Client = require('ssh2-sftp-client');

  const config = {
    host: 'example.com',
    username: 'donald',
    password: 'my-secret'
  };

  const sftp = new Client('example-client');

  sftp.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return sftp.cwd();
    })
    .then(p => {
      console.log(`Remote working directory is ${p}`);
      return sftp.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(`Error: ${err.message}`); // error message will include 'example-client'
    });
#+end_src

*** connect(config) ===> SFTP object

Connect to an sftp server. Full documentation for connection options is
available [[https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2#user-content-client-methods][here]]

**** Connection Options

This module is based on the excellent [[https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2#client][SSH2]] module. That module is a general SSH2
client and server library and provides much more functionality than just SFTP
connectivity. Many of the connect options provided by that module are less
relevant for SFTP connections. It is recommended you keep the config options to
the minimum needed and stick to the options listed in the ~commonOpts~ below.

The ~retries~, ~retry_factor~ and ~retry_minTimeout~ options are not part of the
SSH2 module. These are part of the configuration for the [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/retry][retry]] package and what
is used to enable retrying of sftp connection attempts. See the documentation
for that package for an explanation of these values.

#+begin_src javascript
  // common options

  let commonOpts {
    host: 'localhost', // string Hostname or IP of server.
    port: 22, // Port number of the server.
    forceIPv4: false, // boolean (optional) Only connect via IPv4 address
    forceIPv6: false, // boolean (optional) Only connect via IPv6 address
    username: 'donald', // string Username for authentication.
    password: 'borsch', // string Password for password-based user authentication
    agent: process.env.SSH_AGENT, // string - Path to ssh-agent's UNIX socket
    privateKey: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/key'), // Buffer or string that contains
    passphrase: 'a pass phrase', // string - For an encrypted private key
    readyTimeout: 20000, // integer How long (in ms) to wait for the SSH handshake
    strictVendor: true // boolean - Performs a strict server vendor check
    debug: myDebug // function - Set this to a function that receives a single
                  // string argument to get detailed (local) debug information.
    retries: 2 // integer. Number of times to retry connecting
    retry_factor: 2 // integer. Time factor used to calculate time between retries
    retry_minTimeout: 2000 // integer. Minimum timeout between attempts
  };

  // rarely used options

  let advancedOpts {
    localAddress,
    localPort,
    hostHash,
    hostVerifier,
    agentForward,
    localHostname,
    localUsername,
    tryKeyboard,
    authHandler,
    keepaliveInterval,
    keepaliveCountMax,
    sock,
    algorithms,
    compress
  };
#+end_src

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  sftp.connect({
    host: example.com,
    port: 22,
    username: 'donald',
    password: 'youarefired'
  });
#+end_src

*** list(path, filter) ==> Array[object]

Retrieves a directory listing. This method returns a Promise, which once
realised, returns an array of objects representing items in the remote
directory.

- path :: {String} Remote directory path
- filter :: (optional) {function} A function used to filter the items included
  in the returned array. The function is called for each item with the item
  object being passed in as the argument. The function is passed to
  Array.filter() to perform the filtering.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  const Client = require('ssh2-sftp-client');

  const config = {
    host: 'example.com',
    port: 22,
    username: 'red-don',
    password: 'my-secret'
  };

  let sftp = new Client;

  sftp.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return sftp.list('/path/to/remote/dir');
    })
    .then(data => {
      console.log(data);
    })
    .then(() => {
      sftp.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

**** Return Objects

The objects in the array returned by ~list()~ have the following properties;

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    type: // file type(-, d, l)
    name: // file name
    size: // file size
    modifyTime: // file timestamp of modified time
    accessTime: // file timestamp of access time
    rights: {
      user:
      group:
      other:
    },
    owner: // user ID
    group: // group ID
    longname: // like ls -l line
  }
#+end_src

*** exists(path) ==> boolean

Tests to see if remote file or directory exists. Returns type of remote object
if it exists or false if it does not.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  const Client = require('ssh2-sftp-client');

  const config = {
    host: 'example.com',
    port: 22,
    username: 'red-don',
    password: 'my-secret'
  };

  let sftp = new Client;

  sftp.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return sftp.exists('/path/to/remote/dir');
    })
    .then(data => {
      console.log(data);          // will be false or d, -, l (dir, file or link)
    })
    .then(() => {
      sftp.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** stat(path) ==> object

Returns the attributes associated with the object pointed to by ~path~.

- path :: String. Remote path to directory or file on remote server

**** Attributes

The ~stat()~ method returns an object with the following properties;

#+begin_src javascript
  let stats = {
    mode: 33279, // integer representing type and permissions
    uid: 1000, // user ID
    gid: 985, // group ID
    size: 5, // file size
    accessTime: 1566868566000, // Last access time. milliseconds
    modifyTime: 1566868566000, // last modify time. milliseconds
    isDirectory: false, // true if object is a directory
    isFile: true, // true if object is a file
    isBlockDevice: false, // true if object is a block device
    isCharacterDevice: false, // true if object is a character device
    isSymbolicLink: false, // true if object is a symbolic link
    isFIFO: false, // true if object is a FIFO
    isSocket: false // true if object is a socket
  };
#+end_src

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.stat('/path/to/remote/file');
    })
    .then(data => {
      // do something with data
    })
    .then(() => {
      client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** get(path, dst, options) ==> String|Stream|Buffer

Retrieve a file from a remote SFTP server. The ~dst~ argument defines the
destination and can be either a string, a stream object or undefined. If it is a
string, it is interpreted as the path to a location on the local file system
(path should include the file name). If it is a stream object, the remote data
is passed to it via a call to pipe(). If ~dst~ is undefined, the method will put
the data into a buffer and return that buffer when the Promise is resolved. If
~dst~ is defined, it is returned when the Promise is resolved.

In general, if you're going to pass in a string as the destination, you are
better off using the ~fastGet()~ method.

- path :: String. Path to the remote file to download
- dst :: String|Stream. Destination for the data. If a string, it
         should be a local file path.
- options :: Options for the ~get()~ command (see below).

**** Options

The ~options~ argument can be used to pass options to the underlying streams and
pipe call used by this method. The argument is an object with three possible
properties, ~readStreamOptions~, ~writeStreamOptions~ and ~pipeOptions~. The
values for each of these properties should be an object containing the required
options. For example, possible read stream and pipe options could be defined as

#+begin_src javascript
  let options = {
    readStreamOptions: {
      flags: 'r',
      encoding: null,
      handle: null,
      mode: 0o666,
      autoClose: true
    },
    pipeOptions: {
      end: false
    }};
  
#+end_src

Most of the time, you won't want to use any options. Sometimes, it may be useful
to set the encoding. For example, to 'utf-8'. However, it is important not to do
this for binary files to avoid data corruption. 

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let client = new Client();

  let remotePath = '/remote/server/path/file.txt';
  let dst = fs.createWriteStream('/local/file/path/copy.txt');

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.get(remotePath, dst);
    })
    .then(() => {
      client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

- Tip :: See examples file in the Git repository for more examples. You can pass
         any writeable stream in as the destination. For example, if you pass in
         ~zlib.createGunzip()~ writeable stream, you can both download and
         decompress a gzip file 'on the fly'.

*** fastGet(remotePath, localPath, options) ===> string

Downloads a file at remotePath to localPath using parallel reads for faster
throughput. This is the simplest method if you just want to download a file.

- remotePath :: String. Path to the remote file to download
- localPath :: String. Path on local file system for the downloaded file. The
               local path should include the filename to use for saving the
               file.
- options :: Options for ~fastGet()~ (see below)

**** Options

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    concurrency: 64, // integer. Number of concurrent reads to use
    chunkSize: 32768, // integer. Size of each read in bytes
    step: function(total_transferred, chunk, total) // callback called each time a
                                                    // chunk is transferred
  }
#+end_src

- Warning :: Some servers do not respond correctly to requests to alter chunk
             size. This can result in lost or corrupted data.

**** Sample Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let client = new Client();
  let remotePath = '/server/path/file.txt';
  let localPath = '/local/path/file.txt';

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      client.fastGet(remotePath, localPath);
    })
    .then(() => {
      client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** put(src, remotePath, options) ==> string

Upload data from local system to remote server. If the ~src~ argument is a
string, it is interpreted as a local file path to be used for the data to
transfer. If the ~src~ argument is a buffer, the contents of the buffer are
copied to the remote file and if it is a readable stream, the contents of that
stream are piped to the ~remotePath~ on the server.

- src :: string | buffer | readable stream. Data source for data to copy to the
         remote server.
- remotePath :: string. Path to the remote file to be created on the server.
- options :: object. Options which can be passed to adjust the read and write stream used
             in sending the data to the remote server or the pipe call used to
             make the data transfer (see below).

**** Options

The options object supports three properties, ~readStreamOptions~,
~writeStreamOptions~ and ~pipeOptions~. The value for each property should be an
object with options as properties and their associated values representing the
option value. For example, you might use the following to set ~writeStream~ options.

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    writeStreamOptions: {
      flags: 'w',  // w - write and a - append
      encoding: null, // use null for binary files
      mode: 0o666, // mode to use for created file (rwx)
  }}
#+end_src

The most common options to use are mode and encoding. The values shown above are
the defaults. You do not have to set encoding to utf-8 for text files, null is
fine for all file types. However, using utf-8 encoding for binary files will
often result in data corruption.

Note that you cannot set ~autoClose: false~ for ~writeStreamOptions~. If you
attempt to set this property to false, it will be ignored. This is necessary to
avoid a race condition which may exist when setting ~autoClose~ to false on the
writeStream. As there is no easy way to access the writeStream once the promise
has been resolved, setting this to autoClose false is not terribly useful as
there is no easy way to manually close the stream after the promise has been
resolved.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let client = new Client();

  let data = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/local/file.txt');
  let remote = '/path/to/remote/file.txt';

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.put(data, remote);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

- Tip :: If the src argument is a path string, consider just using ~fastPut()~.

*** fastPut(localPath, remotePath, options) ==> string

Uploads the data in file at ~localPath~ to a new file on remote server at
~remotePath~ using concurrency. The options object allows tweaking of the fast put process.

- localPath :: string. Path to local file to upload
- remotePath :: string. Path to remote file to create
- options :: object. Options passed to createWriteStream (see below)

**** Options

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    concurrency: 64, // integer. Number of concurrent reads
    chunkSize: 32768, // integer. Size of each read in bytes
    mode: 0o755, // mixed. Integer or string representing the file mode to set
    step: function(total_transferred, chunk, total) // function. Called every time
    // a part of a file was transferred
  }
#+end_src

- Warning :: There have been reports that some SFTP servers will not honour
             requests for non-default chunk sizes. This can result in data loss
             or corruption.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let localFile = '/path/to/file.txt';
  let remoteFile = '/path/to/remote/file.txt';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      client.fastPut(localFile, remoteFile);
    })
    .then(() => {
      client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** append(input, remotePath, options) ==> string

Append the ~input~ data to an existing remote file. There is no integrity
checking performed apart from normal writeStream checks. This function simply
opens a writeStream on the remote file in append mode and writes the data passed
in to the file.

- input :: buffer | readStream. Data to append to remote file
- remotePath :: string. Path to remote file
- options :: object. Options to pass to writeStream (see below)

**** Options

The following options are supported;

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    flags: 'a',  // w - write and a - append
    encoding: null, // use null for binary files
    mode: 0o666, // mode to use for created file (rwx)
    autoClose: true // automatically close the write stream when finished
  }
#+end_src

The most common options to use are mode and encoding. The values shown above are
the defaults. You do not have to set encoding to utf-8 for text files, null is
fine for all file types. Generally, I would not attempt to append binary files.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let remotePath = '/path/to/remote/file.txt';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.append(Buffer.from('Hello world'), remotePath);
    })
    .then(() => {

*** mkdir(path, recursive) ==> string

Create a new directory. If the recursive flag is set to true, the method will
create any directories in the path which do not already exist. Recursive flag
defaults to false.

- path :: string. Path to remote directory to create
- recursive :: boolean. If true, create any missing directories in the path as
               well

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let remoteDir = '/path/to/new/dir';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.mkdir(remoteDir, true);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** rmdir(path, recursive) ==> string

Remove a directory. If removing a directory and recursive flag is set to
~true~, the specified directory and all sub-directories and files will be
deleted. If set to false and the directory has sub-directories or files, the
action will fail.

- path :: string. Path to remote directory
- recursive :: boolean. If true, remove all files and directories in target
               directory. Defaults to false

*Note*: There has been at least one report that some SFTP servers will allow
non-empty directories to be removed even without the recursive flag being set to
true. While this is not standard behaviour, it is recommended that users verify
the behaviour of rmdir if there are plans to rely on the recursive flag to
prevent removal of non-empty directories.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let remoteDir = '/path/to/remote/dir';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.rmdir(remoteDir, true);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** delete(path, noErrorOK) ==> string

Delete a file on the remote server.

- path :: string. Path to remote file to be deleted.

- noErrorOK :: boolean. If true, no error is raised when you try to delete a
  non-existent file. Default is false.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let remoteFile = '/path/to/remote/file.txt';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.delete(remoteFile);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** rename(fromPath, toPath) ==> string

Rename a file or directory from ~fromPath~ to ~toPath~. You must have the
necessary permissions to modify the remote file.

- fromPath :: string. Path to existing file to be renamed
- toPath :: string. Path to new file existing file is to be renamed to. Should
  not already exist.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let from = '/remote/path/to/old.txt';
  let to = '/remote/path/to/new.txt';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.rename(from, to);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** posixRename(fromPath, toPath) ==> string

This method uses the openssh POSIX rename extension introduced in OpenSSH 4.8.
The advantage of this version of rename over standard SFTP rename is that it is
an atomic operation and will allow renaming a resource where the destination
name exists. The POSIX rename will also work on some file systems which do not
support standard SFTP rename because they don't support the system hardlink()
call. The POSIX rename extension is available on all openSSH servers from 4.8
and some other implementations. This is an extension to the standard SFTP
protocol and therefore is not supported on all sftp servers.

- fromPath :: string. Path to existing file to be renamed.
- toPath :: string. Path for new name. If it already exists, it will be replaced
  by file specified in fromPath

#+begin_src javascript
  let from = '/remote/path/to/old.txt';
  let to = '/remote/path/to/new.txt';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.posixRename(from, to);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** chmod(path, mode) ==> string

Change the mode (read, write or execute permissions) of a remote file or
directory.

- path :: string. Path to the remote file or directory
- mode :: octal. New mode to set for the remote file or directory

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let path = '/path/to/remote/file.txt';
  let newMode = 0o644;  // rw-r-r
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.chmod(path, newMode);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** realPath(path) ===> string

Converts a relative path to an absolute path on the remote server. This method
is mainly used internally to resolve remote path names.

*Warning*: Currently, there is a platform inconsistency with this method on
win32 platforms. For servers running on non-win32 platforms, providing a path
which does not exist on the remote server will result in an empty e.g. '',
absolute path being returned. On servers running on win32 platforms, a
normalised path will be returned even if the path does not exist on the remote
server. It is therefore advised not to use this method to also verify a path
exists. instead, use the ~exist()~ method.

- path :: A file path, either relative or absolute. Can handle '.' and '..', but
  does not expand '~'.

*** cwd() ==> string

Returns what the server believes is the current remote working directory.

*** uploadDir(srcDir, dstDir, options) ==> string

Upload the directory specified by ~srcDir~ to the remote directory specified by
~dstDir~. The ~dstDir~ will be created if necessary. Any sub directories within
~srcDir~ will also be uploaded. Any existing files in the remote path will be
overwritten.

The upload process also emits 'upload' events. These events are fired for each
successfully uploaded file. The ~upload~ event calls listeners with 1 argument,
an object which has properties source and destination. The source property is
the path of the file uploaded and the destination property is the path to where
the file was uploaded. The purpose of this event is to provide some way for
client code to get feedback on the upload progress. You can add your own listener
using the ~on()~ method.

The 3rd argument is an options object with two supported properties, ~filter~ and ~useFastput~. 

The ~filter~ option is a function which will be called for each item
to be uploaded. The function will be called with two arguments. The first
argument is the full path of the item to be uploaded and the second argument is
a boolean, which will be true if the target path is for a directory. The filter
function will be called for each item in the source path. If the function
returns true, the item will be uploaded. If it returns false, it will be
filtered and not uploaded. The filter function is called via the ~Array.filter~
method. These array comprehension methods are known to be unsafe for
asynchronous functions. Therefore, only synchronous filter functions are
supported at this time.

The ~useFastput~ option is a boolean option. If ~true~, the method will use the
faster ~fastPut()~ method to upload files. Although this method is faster, it is
not supported by all SFTP servers. Enabling this option when unsupported by the
remote SFTP server will result in failures.

- srcDir :: A local file path specified as a string
- dstDir :: A remote file path specified as a string
- options :: An options object which supports two properties, ~filter~ and
  ~useFastput~. A filter predicate function which is called for each item in the
  source path. The argument will receive two arguments. The first is the full
  path to the item and the second is a boolean which will be true if the item is
  a directory. If the function returns true, the item will be uploaded,
  otherwise it will be filtered out and ignored. The ~useFastput~ option is a
  boolean option. If ~true~, the method will use the faster, but less supported,
  ~fastPut()~ method to transfer files. The default is to use the slightly slower,
  but better supported, ~put()~ method.
  
**** Example

     #+begin_src javascript
       'use strict';

       // Example of using the uploadDir() method to upload a directory
       // to a remote SFTP server

       const path = require('path');
       const SftpClient = require('../src/index');

       const dotenvPath = path.join(__dirname, '..', '.env');
       require('dotenv').config({path: dotenvPath});

       const config = {
         host: process.env.SFTP_SERVER,
         username: process.env.SFTP_USER,
         password: process.env.SFTP_PASSWORD,
         port: process.env.SFTP_PORT || 22
       };

       async function main() {
         const client = new SftpClient('upload-test');
         const src = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'test', 'testData', 'upload-src');
         const dst = '/home/tim/upload-test';

         try {
           await client.connect(config);
           client.on('upload', info => {
             console.log(`Listener: Uploaded ${info.source}`);
           });
           let rslt = await client.uploadDir(src, dst);
           return rslt;
         } catch (err) {
           console.error(err);
         } finally {
           client.end();

         .catch(err => {
           console.log(`main error: ${err.message}`);
         });

     #+end_src

*** downloadDir(srcDir, dstDir, options) ==> string

Download the remote directory specified by ~srcDir~ to the local file system
directory specified by ~dstDir~. The ~dstDir~ directory will be created if
required. All sub directories within ~srcDir~ will also be copied. Any existing
files in the local path will be overwritten. No files in the local path will be
deleted.

The method also emits ~download~ events to provide a way to monitor download
progress. The download event listener is called with one argument, an object
with two properties, source and destination. The source property is the path to
the remote file that has been downloaded and the destination is the local path
to where the file was downloaded to. You can add a listener for this event using
the ~on()~ method.

The ~options~ argument is an options object with two supported properties, ~filter~
and ~useFastget~. The ~filter~ argument is a predicate function which will be called
with two arguments for each potential item to be downloaded. The first argument
is the full path of the item and the second argument is a boolean, which will be
true if the item is a directory. If the function returns true, the item will be
included in the download. If it returns false, it will be filtered and ignored.
The filter function is called via the ~Array.filter~ method. These array
comprehension methods are known to be unsafe for asynchronous functions.
Therefore, only synchronous filter functions are supported at this time.

If the ~useFastget~ property is set to ~true~, the method will use ~fastGet()~ to
transfer files. The ~fastGet~ method is faster, but not supported by all SFTP
services.

- srcDir :: A remote file path specified as a string
- dstDir :: A local file path specified as a string
- options :: An object with two supported properties, ~filter~ and ~useFastget~. The
  filter property is a function accepting two arguments, the full path to an
  item and a boolean value which will be true if the item is a directory. The
  function is called for each item in the download path and should return true
  to include the item and false to exclude it in the download. The ~useFastget~
  property is a boolean. If true, the ~fastGet()~ method will be used to transfer
  files. If ~false~ (the default), the slower but better supported ~get()~ method is
  used. .

*** createReadStream(remotePath, options)) ==> stream object

  Returns a read stream object which is attached to the remote file specified by
  the ~remotePath~ argument. This is a low level method which just returns a read
  stream object. Client code is fully responsible for managing and releasing the
  resources associated with the stream once finished i.e. closing files,
  removing listeners etc. 

  - remotePath :: A remote file path specified as a string
  - options :: An options object. Supported properties are 
    - flags :: defaults to 'r'
    - encoding :: defaults to null
    - handle :: defaults to null
    - mode :: 0o666
    - autoClose :: defaults to true. If set to false, client code is responsible
      for closing file descriptors when finished
    - start :: Default 0. Position to start reading bytes from (inclusive)
    - end :: Position to stop reading bytes (inclusive). 

*** createWriteStream(remotePath, options) ==> stream object

   Returns a write stream object which is attached to the remote file specified
   in the ~remotePath~ argument. This is a low level function which just returns
   the stream object. Client code is fully responsible for managing that object,
   including closing any file descriptors and removing listeners etc.

   - remotePath :: Path to the remote file specified as a string
   - options :: An object containing stream options. Supported properties include 
     - flags :: default 'w'
     - encoding :: default null
     - mode :: 0o666
     - autoClose :: true 
     - start :: Byte position to start writing from (inclusive). May require
       changing flag to 'r+'.

*** rcopy(srcPath, dstPath) ==> string

   Perform a remote file copy. The file identified by the ~srcPath~ argument will
   be copied to the file specified as the ~dstPath~ argument. The directory where
   ~dstPath~ will be placed must exist, but the actual file must not i.e. no
   overwrites allowed. 

   - srcPath :: Path to remote file to be copied specified as a string
   - dstPath :: Path to where the copy will be created specified as a string

*** end() ==> boolean

Ends the current client session, releasing the client socket and associated
resources. This function also removes all listeners associated with the client.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      // do some sftp stuff
    })
    .then(() => {

    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** Add and Remove Listeners

Although normally not required, you can add and remove custom listeners on the
ssh2 client object. This object supports a number of events, but only a few of
them have any meaning in the context of SFTP. These are

- error :: An error occurred. Calls listener with an error argument.
- end :: The socket has been disconnected. No argument.
- close :: The socket was closed. 

**** on(eventType, listener)

Adds the specified listener to the specified event type. It the event type is
~error~, the listener should accept 1 argument, which will be an Error object.
The event handlers for =end= and =close= events have no arguments.

The handlers will be added to the beginning of the listener's event handlers, so
it will be called before any of the =ssh2-sftp-client= listeners.

**** removeListener(eventType, listener)

Removes the specified listener from the event specified in eventType. Note that
the ~end()~ method automatically removes all listeners from the client object.

* Platform Quirks & Warnings
** Server Capabilities

   All SFTP servers and platforms are not equal. Some facilities provided by
   ~ssh2-sftp-client~ either depend on capabilities of the remote server or the
   underlying capabilities of the remote server platform. As an example,
   consider ~chmod()~. This command depends on a remote file system which
   implements the 'nix' concept of users and groups. The /win32/ platform does
   not have the same concept of users and groups, so ~chmod()~ will not behave
   in the same way.

   One way to determine whether an issue you are encountering is due to
   ~ssh2-sftp-client~ or due to the remote server or server platform is to use a
   simple CLI sftp program, such as openSSH's sftp command. If you observe the
   same behaviour using plain ~sftp~ on the command line, the issue is likely
   due to server or remote platform limitations. Note that you should not use a
   GUI sftp client, like ~Filezilla~ or ~winSCP~ as such GUI programs often
   attempt to hide these server and platform incompatibilities and will take
   additional steps to simulate missing functionality etc. You want to use a CLI
   program which does as little as possible.

** Issues with ~fastPut()~ and ~fastGet()~ Methods

   The ~fastPut()~ and ~fastGet()~ methods are known to be somewhat dependent on
   SFTP server capabilities. Some SFTP servers just do not work correctly with
   concurrent connections and some are known to have issues with negotiating
   packet sizes. These issues can sometimes be resolved by tweaking the options
   supplied to the methods, such as setting number of concurrent connections or
   a specific packet size.

   To see an example of the type of issues you can observe with ~fastPut()~ or
   ~fastGet()~, have a look at [[https://github.com/theophilusx/ssh2-sftp-client/issues/407][issue 407]], which describes the experiences of one
   user. Bottom line, when it works, it tends to work well and be significantly
   faster than using just ~get()~ or ~put()~. However, when developing code to
   run against different SFTP servers, especially where you are unable to test
   against each server, you are likely better off just using ~get()~ and ~put()~
   or structuring your code so that users can select which method to use (this
   is what =ssh2-sftp-client= does - for example, see the ~!downloadDir()~ and
   ~uploadDir()~ methods.
   
** Promises, Events & Managing Exceptions

   One of the challenges in providing a Promise based API over a module like
   SSH2, which is event based is how to ensure events are handled appropriately.
   The challenge is due to the synchronous nature of events. You cannot use
   =try/catch= for events because you have no way of knowing when the event
   might fire. For example, it could easily fire after your =try/catch= block as
   completed execution.

   Things become even more complicated once you mix in Promises. When you define
   a promise, you have to methods which can be called to fulfil a promise,
   =resolve= and =reject=. Only one can be called - once you call =resolve=, you
   cannot call =reject= (well, you can call it, but it won't have any impact on
   the fulfilment status of the promise). The problem arises when an event, for
   example an =error= event is fired either after you have resolved a promise or
   possibly in-between promises. If you don't catch the =error= event, your
   script will likely crash with an =uncaught exception= error.

   To make matters worse, some servers, particularly servers running on a
   Windows platform, will raise multiple errors for the same error /event/. For
   example, when you attempt to connect with a bad username or password, you
   will get a =All authentication methods have failed= exception. However, under
   Windows, you will also get a =Connection reset by peer= exception. If we
   reject the connect promise based on the authentication failure exception,
   what do we do with the =reset by peer= exception? More critically, what will
   handle that exception given the promise has already been fulfilled and
   completed? To make matters worse, it seems that Windows based servers also
   raise an error event for /non-errors/. For example, when you call the =end()=
   method, the connection is closed. On windows, this also results in a
   /connection reset by peer/ error. While it could be argued that the remote
   server resetting the connection after receiving a disconnect request is not
   an error, it doesn't change the fact that one is raised and we need to
   somehow deal with it.

   To handle this, =ssh2-sftp-client= implements a couple of strategies.
   Firstly, when you call one of the module's methods, it adds =error=, =end=
   and =close= event listeners which will call the =reject= method on the
   enclosing promise. It also keeps track of whether an error has been handled
   and if it has, it ignores any subsequent errors until the promise ends.
   Typically, the first error caught has the most relevant information and any
   subsequent error events are less critical or informative, so ignoring them
   has no negative impact. Provided one of the events is raised before the
   promise is fulfilled, these handlers will consume the event and deal with it
   appropriately.

   In testing, it was found that in some situations, particularly during connect
   operations, subsequent errors fired with a small delay. This prevents the
   errors from being handled by the event handlers associated with the connect
   promise. To deal with this, a small 500ms delay has been added to the
   connect() method, which effectively delays the removal of the event handlers
   until all events have been caught.

   The other area where additional events are fired is during the end() call. To
   deal with these events, the =end()= method sets up listeners which will
   simply ignore additional =error=, =end= and =close= events. It is assumed
   that once you have called =end()= you really only care about any main error
   which occurs and no longer care about other errors that may be raised as the
   connection is terminated.

   In addition to the promise based event handlers, =ssh2-sftp-client= also
   implements global event handlers which will catch any =error=, =end= or
   =close= events. Essentially, these global handlers only reset the =sftp=
   property of the client object, effectively ensuring any subsequent calls are
   rejected and in the case of an error, send the error to the console.

*** Adding Custom Handlers

    While the above strategies appear to work for the majority of use cases,
    there are always going to be edge cases which require more flexible or
    powerful event handling. To support this, the =on()= and =removeListener()=
    methods are provided. Any event listener added using the =on()= method will
    be added at the beginning of the list of handlers for that event, ensuring
    it will be called before any global or promise local events. See the
    documentation for the =on()= method for details.
    
** Windows Based Servers

   It appears that when the sftp server is running on Windows, a /ECONNRESET/
   error signal is raised when the end() method is called. Unfortunately, this
   signal is raised after a considerable delay. This means we cannot remove the
   error handler used in the end() promise as otherwise you will get an uncaught
   exception error. Leaving the handler in place, even though we will ignore
   this error, solves that issue, but unfortunately introduces a new problem.
   Because we are not removing the listener, if you re-use the client object for
   subsequent connections, an additional error handler will be added. If this
   happens more than 11 times, you will eventually see the Node warning about a
   possible memory leak. This is because node monitors the number of error
   handlers and if it sees more than 11 added to an object, it assumes there is
   a problem and generates the warning.

   The best way to avoid this issue is to not re-use client objects. Always
   generate a new sftp client object for each new connection.

** Don't Re-use SftpClient Objects

   Due to an issue with /ECONNRESET/ error signals when connecting to Windows
   based SFTP servers, it is not possible to remove the error handler in the
   end() method. This means that if you re-use the SftpClient object for
   multiple connections e.g. calling connect(), then end(), then connect() etc,
   you run the risk of multiple error handlers being added to the SftpClient
   object. After 11 handlers have been added, Node will generate a possible
   memory leak warning.

   To avoid this problem, don't re-use SftpClient objects. Generate a new
   SftpClient object for each connection. You can perform multiple actions with
   a single connection e.g. upload multiple files, download multiple files etc,
   but after you have called end(), you should not try to re-use the object with
   a further connect() call. Create a new object instead.

* FAQ

** Remote server drops connections with only an end event

Many SFTP servers have rate limiting protection which will drop connections once
a limit has been reached. In particular, openSSH has the setting ~MaxStartups~,
which can be a tuple of the form =max:drop:full= where =max= is the maximum
allowed unauthenticated connections, =drop= is a percentage value which
specifies percentage of connections to be dropped once =max= connections has
been reached and =full= is the number of connections at which point all
subsequent connections will be dropped. e.g. =10:30:60= means allow up to 10
unauthenticated connections after which drop 30% of connection attempts until
reaching 60 unauthenticated connections, at which time, drop all attempts.

Clients first make an unauthenticated connection to the SFTP server to begin
negotiation of protocol settings (cipher, authentication method etc). If you are
creating multiple connections in a script, it is easy to exceed the limit,
resulting in some connections being dropped. As SSH2 only raises an 'end' event
for these dropped connections, no error is detected. The ~ssh2-sftp-client~ now
listens for ~end~ events during the connection process and if one is detected,
will reject the connection promise.

One way to avoid this type of issue is to add a delay between connection
attempts. It does not need to be a very long delay - just sufficient to permit
the previous connection to be authenticated. In fact, the default setting for
openSSH is =10:30:60=, so you really just need to have enough delay to ensure
that the 1st connection has completed authentication before the 11th connection
is attempted.

** How can I pass writeable stream as dst for get method?

If the dst argument passed to the get method is a writeable stream, the remote
file will be piped into that writeable. If the writeable you pass in is a
writeable stream created with ~fs.createWriteStream()~, the data will be written
to the file specified in the constructor call to ~createWriteStream()~.

The writeable stream can be any type of write stream. For example, the below code
will convert all the characters in the remote file to upper case before it is
saved to the local file system. This could just as easily be something like a
gunzip stream from ~zlib~, enabling you to decompress remote zipped files as you
bring them across before saving to local file system.

#+begin_src javascript
  'use strict';

  // Example of using a writeable with get to retrieve a file.
  // This code will read the remote file, convert all characters to upper case
  // and then save it to a local file

  const Client = require('../src/index.js');
  const path = require('path');
  const fs = require('fs');
  const through = require('through2');

  const config = {
    host: 'arch-vbox',
    port: 22,
    username: 'tim',
    password: 'xxxx'
  };

  const sftp = new Client();
  const remoteDir = '/home/tim/testServer';

  function toupper() {
    return through(function(buf, enc, next) {
      next(null, buf.toString().toUpperCase());
    });
  }

  sftp
    .connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return sftp.list(remoteDir);
    })
    .then(data => {
      // list of files in testServer
      console.dir(data);
      let remoteFile = path.join(remoteDir, 'test.txt');
      let upperWtr = toupper();
      let fileWtr = fs.createWriteStream(path.join(__dirname, 'loud-text.txt'));
      upperWtr.pipe(fileWtr);
      return sftp.get(remoteFile, upperWtr);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return sftp.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);

** How can I upload files without having to specify a password?

There are a couple of ways to do this. Essentially, you want to setup SSH keys
and use these for authentication to the remote server.

One solution, provided by @KalleVuorjoki is to use the SSH agent
process. *Note*: SSH_AUTH_SOCK is normally created by your OS when you load the
ssh-agent as part of the login session.

#+begin_src javascript
  let sftp = new Client();
  sftp.connect({
    host: 'YOUR-HOST',
    port: 'YOUR-PORT',
    username: 'YOUR-USERNAME',
    agent: process.env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK
  }).then(() => {
    sftp.fastPut(/* ... */)
  }
#+end_src

Another alternative is to just pass in the SSH key directly as part of the
configuration.

#+begin_src javascript
  let sftp = new Client();
  sftp.connect({
    host: 'YOUR-HOST',
    port: 'YOUR-PORT',
    username: 'YOUR-USERNAME',
    privateKey: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/ssh/key')
  }).then(() => {
    sftp.fastPut(/* ... */)
  }
#+end_src

** How can I connect through a Socks Proxy

This solution was provided by @jmorino.

#+begin_src javascript
  import { SocksClient } from 'socks';
  import SFTPClient from 'ssh2-sftp-client';

  const host = 'my-sftp-server.net';
  const port = 22; // default SSH/SFTP port on remote server

  // connect to SOCKS 5 proxy
  const { socks } = await SocksClient.createConnection({
    proxy: {
      host: 'my.proxy', // proxy hostname
      port: 1080, // proxy port
      type: 5, // for SOCKS v5
    },
    command: 'connect',
    destination: { host, port } // the remote SFTP server
  });

  const client = new SFTPClient();
  client.connect({
    host,
    sock: socks.socket, // pass the socket to proxy here (see ssh2 doc)
    username: '.....',
    privateKey: '.....'
  })

  // client is connected
#+end_src

** Timeout while waiting for handshake or handshake errors

Some users have encountered the error 'Timeout while waiting for handshake' or
'Handshake failed, no matching client->server ciphers. This is often due to the
client not having the correct configuration for the transport layer algorithms
used by ssh2. One of the connect options provided by the ssh2 module is
~algorithm~, which is an object that allows you to explicitly set the key
exchange, ciphers, hmac and compression algorithms as well as server
host key used to establish the initial secure connection. See the SSH2
documentation for details. Getting these parameters correct usually resolves the
issue.

When encountering this type of problem, one worthwhile approach is to use
openSSH's CLI sftp program with the =-v= switch to raise logging levels. This
will show you what algorithms the CLI is using. You can then use this
information to match the names with the accepted algorithm names documented in
the =ssh2= README to set the properties in the =algorithms= object.

** How can I limit upload/download speed

   If you want to limit the amount of bandwidth used during upload/download of
   data, you can use a stream to limit throughput. The following example was
   provided by /kennylbj/. Note that there is a caveat that we must set the
   ~autoClose~ flag to false to avoid calling an extra ~_read()~ on a closed stream
   that may cause _get Permission Denied error in ssh2-streams.


   #+begin_src javascript


     const Throttle = require('throttle');
     const progress = require('progress-stream');

     // limit download speed
     const throttleStream = new Throttle(config.throttle);

     // download progress stream
     const progressStream = progress({
       length: fileSize,
       time: 500,
     });
     progressStream.on('progress', (progress) => {
       console.log(progress.percentage.toFixed(2));
     });

     const outStream = createWriteStream(localPath);

     // pipe streams together
     throttleStream.pipe(progressStream).pipe(outStream);

     try {
       // set autoClose to false
       await client.get(remotePath, throttleStream, { autoClose: false });
     } catch (e) {
       console.log('sftp error', e);
     } finally {
       await client.end();
     }
   #+end_src
** Connection hangs or fails for larger files

 This was contributed by Ladislav Jacho. Thanks. 

 A symptom of this issue is that you are able to upload small files, but
 uploading larger ones fail. You probably have an MTU/fragmentation problem. For
 each network interface on both client and server set the MTU to 576, e.g.
 =ifconfig eth0 mtu 576=. If that works, you need to find the largest MTU which
 will work for your network. An MTU which is too small will adversely affect
 throughput speed. A common value to use is an MTU of 1400.

* Examples

I have started collecting example scripts in the example directory of the
repository. These are mainly scripts I have put together in order to investigate
issues or provide samples for users. They are not robust, lack adequate error
handling and may contain errors. However, I think they are still useful for
helping developers see how the module and API can be used.

* Troubleshooting

The ~ssh2-sftp-client~ module is essentially a wrapper around the ~ssh2~ and
~ssh2-streams~ modules, providing a higher level ~promise~ based API. When you
run into issues, it is important to try and determine where the issue lies -
either in the ssh2-sftp-client module or the underlying ~ssh2~ and
~ssh2-streams~ modules. One way to do this is to first identify a minimal
reproducible example which reproduces the issue. Once you have that, try to
replicate the functionality just using the ~ssh2~ and ~ssh2-streams~ modules. If
the issue still occurs, then you can be fairly confident it is something related
to those later 2 modules and therefore and issue which should be referred to the
maintainer of that module.

The ~ssh2~ and ~ssh2-streams~ modules are very solid, high quality modules with
a large user base. Most of the time, issues with those modules are due to client
misconfiguration. It is therefore very important when trying to diagnose an
issue to also check the documentation for both ~ssh2~ and ~ssh2-streams~. While
these modules have good defaults, the flexibility of the ssh2 protocol means
that not all options are available by default. You may need to tweak the
connection options, ssh2 algorithms and ciphers etc for some remote servers. The
documentation for both the ~ssh2~ and ~ssh2-streams~ module is quite
comprehensive and there is lots of valuable information in the issue logs.

If you run into an issue which is not repeatable with just the ~ssh2~ and
~ssh2-streams~ modules, then please log an issue against the ~ssh2-sftp-client~
module and I will investigate. Please note the next section on logging issues.

Note also that in the repository there are two useful directories. The first is
the examples directory, which contain some examples of using ~ssh2-sftp-client~
to perform common tasks. A few minutes reviewing these examples can provide that
additional bit of detail to help fix any problems you are encountering.

The second directory is the validation directory. I have some very simple
scripts in this directory which perform basic tasks using only the ~ssh2~
modules (no ~ssh2-sftp-client~ module). These can be useful when
trying to determine if the issue is with the underlying ~ssh2~ module or
the ~ssh2-sftp-client~ wrapper module.

** Common Errors

   There are some common errors people tend to make when using Promises or
   Async/Await. These are by far the most common problem found in issues logged
   against this module. Please check for some of these before logging your
   issue.

*** Not returning the promise in a ~then()~ block

    All methods in ~ssh2-sftp-client~ return a Promise. This means methods are
    executed /asynchrnously/. When you call a method inside the ~then()~ block
    of a promise chain, it is critical that you return the Promise that call
    generates. Failing to do this will result in the ~then()~ block completing
    and your code starting execution of the next ~then()~, ~catch()~ or
    ~finally()~ block before your promise has been fulfilled. For example, the
    following will not do what you expect

    #+begin_src javascript
      sftp.connect(config)
        .then(() => {
          sftp.fastGet('foo.txt', 'bar.txt');
        }).then(rslt => {
          console.log(rslt);
          sftp.end();
        }).catch(e => {
          console.error(e.message);
        });
    #+end_src

    In the above code, the ~sftp.end()~ method will almost certainly be called
    before ~sftp.fastGet()~ has been fulfilled (unless the /foo.txt/ file is
    really small!). In fact, the whole promise chain will complete and exit even
    before the ~sftp.end()~ call has been fulfilled. The correct code would be
    something like

    #+begin_src javascript
      sftp.connect(config)
        .then(() => {
          return sftp.fastGet('foo.txt', 'bar.txt');
        }).then(rslt => {
          console.log(rslt);
          return sftp.end();
        }).catch(e => {
          console.error(e.message);
        });
    #+end_src

    Note the ~return~ statements. These ensure that the Promise returned by the
    client method is returned into the promise chain. It will be this promise
    the next block in the chain will wait on to be fulfilled before the next
    block is executed. Without the return statement, that block will return the
    default promise for that block, which essentially says /this block has been
    fulfilled/. What you really want is the promise which says /your sftp client
    method call has been fulfilled/.

    A common symptom of this type of error is for file uploads or download to
    fail to complete or for data in those files to be truncated. What is
    happening is that the connection is being ended before the transfer has
    completed.

*** Mixing Promise Chains and Async/Await

    Another common error is to mix Promise chains and async/await calls. This is
    rarely a great idea. While you can do this, it tends to create complicated
    and difficult to maintain code. Select one approach and stick with it. Both
    approaches are functionally equivalent, so there is no reason to mix up the
    two paradigms. My personal preference would be to use async/await as I think
    that is more /natural/ for most developers. For example, the following is
    more complex and difficult to follow than necessary (and has a bug!)

    #+begin_src javascript
      sftp.connect(config)
        .then(() => {
          return sftp.cwd();
        }).then(async (d) => {
          console.log(`Remote directory is ${d}`);
          try {
            await sftp.fastGet(`${d}/foo.txt`, `./bar.txt`);
          }.catch(e => {
            console.error(e.message);
          });
        }).catch(e => {
          console.error(e.message);
        }).finally(() => {
          sftp.end();
        });
    #+end_src

    The main bug in the above code is the ~then()~ block is not returning the
    Promise generated by the call to ~sftp.fastGet()~. What it is actually
    returning is a fulfilled promise which says the ~then()~ block has been run
    (note that the await'ed promise is not being returned and is therefore
    outside the main Promise chain). As a result, the ~finally()~ block will be
    executed before the await promise has been fulfilled.

    Using async/await inside the promise chain has created unnecessary
    complexity and leads to incorrect assumptions regarding how the code will
    execute. A quick glance at the code is likely to give the impression that
    execution will wait for the ~sftp.fastGet()~ call to be fulfilled before
    continuing. This is not the case. The code would be more clearly expressed
    as either

    #+begin_src javascript
      sftp.connect(config)
        .then(() => {
          return sftp.cwd();
        }).then(d => {
          console.log(`remote dir ${d}`);
          return sftp.fastGet(`${d}/foot.txt`, 'bar.txt');
        }).catch(e => {
          console.error(e.message);
        }).finally(() => {
          return sftp.end();
        });
    #+end_src

   *or, using async/await*

   #+begin_src javascript
     async function doSftp() {
       try {
         let sftp = await sftp.connect(conf);
         let d = await sftp.cwd();
         console.log(`remote dir is ${d}`);
         await sftp.fastGet(`${d}/foo.txt`, 'bat.txt');
       } catch (e) {
         console.error(e.message);
       } finally () {
         await sftp.end();
       }
     }
   #+end_src

*** Try/catch and Error Handlers

    Another common error is to try and use a try/catch block to catch event
    signals, such as an error event. In general, you cannot use try/catch blocks
    for asynchronous code and expect errors to be caught by the ~catch~ block.
    Handling errors in asynchronous code is one of the key reasons we now have
    the Promise and async/await frameworks.

    The basic problem is that the try/catch block will have completed execution
    before the asynchronous code has completed. If the asynchronous code has not
    completed, then there is a potential for it to raise an error. However, as
    the try/catch block has already completed, there is no /catch/ waiting to
    catch the error. It will bubble up and probably result in your script
    exiting with an uncaught exception error.

    Error events are essentially asynchronous code. You don't know when such
    events will fire. Therefore, you cannot use a try/catch block to catch such
    event errors. Even creating an error handler which then throws an exception
    won't help as the key problem is that your try/catch block has already
    executed. There are a number of alternative ways to deal with this
    situation. However, the key symptom is that you see occasional uncaught
    error exceptions that cause your script to exit abnormally despite having
    try/catch blocks in your script. What you need to do is look at your code
    and find where errors are raised asynchronously and use an event handler or
    some other mechanism to manage any errors raised.

*** Server Differences

    Not all SFTP servers are the same. Like most standards, the SFTP protocol
    has some level of interpretation and allows different levels of compliance.
    This means there can be differences in behaviour between different servers
    and code which works with one server will not work the same with another.
    For example, the value returned by /realpath/ for non-existent objects can
    differ significantly. Some servers will throw an error for a particular
    operation while others will just return null, some servers support
    concurrent operations (such as used by fastGet/fastPut) while others will
    not and of course, the text of error messages can vary significantly. In
    particular, we have noticed significant differences across different
    platforms. It is therefore advisable to do comprehensive testing when the
    SFTP server is moved to a new platform. This includes moving from to a cloud
    based service even if the underlying platform remains the same. I have
    noticed that some cloud platforms can generate unexpected events, possibly
    related to additional functionality or features associated with the cloud
    implementation. For example, it appears SFTP servers running under Azure
    will generate an error event when the connection is closed even when the
    client has requested the connection be terminated. The same SFTP server
    running natively on Windows does not appear to exhibit such behaviour.

*** Avoid Concurrent Operations

    Technically, SFTP should be able to perform multiple operations
    concurrently. As node is single threaded, what we a really talking about is
    running multiple execution contexts as a pool where node will switch
    contexts when each context is blocked due to things like waiting on network
    data etc. However, I have found this to be extremely unreliable and of very
    little benefit from a performance perspective. My recommendation is to
    therefore avoid executing multiple requests over the same connection in
    parallel (for example, generating multiple ~get()~ promises and using
    something like ~Promise.all()~ to resolve them.

    If you are going to try and perform concurrent operations, you need to test
    extensively and ensure you are using data which is large enough that context
    switching does occur (i.e. the request is not completed in a single run).
    Some SFTP servers will handle concurrent operations better than others.

** Debugging Support

You can add a ~debug~ property to the config object passed in to ~connect()~ to
turn on debugging. This will generate quite a lot of output. The value of the
property should be a function which accepts a single string argument. For example;

#+begin_src javascript
  config.debug = msg => {
    console.error(msg);
  };

#+end_src

Enabling debugging can generate a lot of output. If you use console.error() as
the output (as in the example above), you can redirect the output to a file
using shell redirection e.g.

#+begin_src shell
  node script.js 2> debug.log

#+end_src

If you just want to see debug messages from ~ssh2-sftp-client~ and exclude debug
messages from the underlying ~ssh2~ and ~ssh2-streams~ modules, you can filter
based on messages which start with 'CLIENT' e.g.

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    debug: (msg) => {
      if (msg.startsWith('CLIENT')) {
        console.error(msg);
      }
    }
  }
#+end_src
* Logging Issues

Please log an issue for all bugs, questions, feature and enhancement
requests. Please ensure you include the module version, node version and
platform.

I am happy to try and help diagnose and fix any issues you encounter while using
the ~ssh2-sftp-client~ module. However, I will only put in effort if you are
prepared to put in the effort to provide the information necessary to reproduce
the issue. Things which will help

- Node version you are using
- Version of ssh2-sftp-client you are using
- Platform your client is running on (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Platform and software for the remote SFTP server when possible
- Example of your code or a minimal script which reproduces the issue you are
  encountering. By far, the most common issue is incorrect use of the module
  API. Example code can usually result in such issues being resolved very
  quickly.

Perhaps the best assistance is a minimal reproducible example of the issue. Once
the issue can be readily reproduced, it can usually be fixed very quickly.

* Pull Requests 

Pull requests are always welcomed. However, please ensure your changes pass all
tests and if you're adding a new feature, that tests for that feature are
included. Likewise, for new features or enhancements, please include any
relevant documentation updates.

*Note*: The =README.md= file is generated from the =README.org= file. Therefore,
any documentation updates or fixes need to be made to the =README.org= file.
This file is /tangled/ using =Emacs= org mode. If you don't use Emacs or
org-mode, don't be too concerned. The org-mode syntax is straight-forward and
similar to /markdown/. I will verify any updates to =README.org= and generate a
new =README.md= when necessary. The main point to note is that any changes made
directly to =README.md= will not persist and will be lost when a new version is
generated, so don't modify that file. 

This module will adopt a standard semantic versioning policy. Please indicate in
your pull request what level of change it represents i.e.

- Major :: Change to API or major change in functionality which will require an
           increase in major version number.
- Minor :: Minor change, enhancement or new feature which does not change
           existing API and will not break existing client code.
- Bug Fix :: No change to functionality or features. Simple fix of an existing
             bug.
