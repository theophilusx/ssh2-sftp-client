#+TITLE: SSH2 SFTP Client

* Overview

an SFTP client for node.js, a wrapper around [[https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2][SSH2]]  which provides a high level
convenience abstraction as well as a Promise based API.

Documentation on the methods and available options in the underlying modules can
be found on the [[https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2][SSH2]] project pages.

Current stable release is *v7.0.0*.

Code has been tested against Node versions 12.22.1, 14.17.0 and 16.2.0

Node versions < 10.x are not supported.

* Installation

#+begin_src shell
npm install ssh2-sftp-client
#+end_src

* Basic Usage

#+begin_src javascript
  let Client = require('ssh2-sftp-client');
  let sftp = new Client();

  sftp.connect({
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: '8080',
    username: 'username',
    password: '******'
  }).then(() => {
    return sftp.list('/pathname');
  }).then(data => {
    console.log(data, 'the data info');
  }).catch(err => {
    console.log(err, 'catch error');
  });
#+end_src

* Version 7.x Changes

- This version is based on version 1.1.0 of ~ssh2~. This version of ~ssh2~ is a
  complete re-write of the ~ssh2~ library. This re-write addresses issues
  encountered when using node v14 as well as some design weaknesses in the
  previous 0.8.x version.

- *Breaking Change* Expanded option handling for ~get()~ and ~put()~ methods. A number of use
  cases were identified where setting specific options on the read and write
  streams and the pipe operation are necessary. For example, disabling
  ~autoClose~ on streams or the ~end~ event in pipes. The ~options~ argument for
  ~get()~ and ~put()~ calls now supports properties for ~readStreamOptions~,
  ~writeStreamOptions~ and ~pipeOptions~. Note that options are only applied to
  streams created by the ~get()~ and ~put()~ methods. Streams passed into these
  methods are under the control of the client code and therefore cannot have
  options supplied in arguments to those streams (you would apply such options
  when you create the streams). Options are typically only necessary in special
  use cases. Most of the time, no options are required. However, if you are
  currently using options to either ~put()~ or ~get()~, you will need to update
  your code to map these options to the new structure. 

- Improved event handling. A listener for a global error event is now defined to
  catch errors which occur in-between method calls i.e. connection lost
  in-between calls to the library methods. A new mechanism has also been added
  for removal of listeners when no longer required. 

* Documentation

The connection options are the same as those offered by the underlying SSH2
module. For full details, please see [[https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2#user-content-client-methods][SSH2 client methods]]

All the methods will return a Promise, except for ~on()~ and
~removeListener()~, which are typically only used in special use cases.

** Specifying Paths

   The convention with both FTP and SFTP is that paths are specified using a
   'nix' style i.e. use ~/~ as the path separator. This means that even if your
   SFTP server is running on a win32 platform, you should use ~/~ instead of ~\~
   as the path separator. For example, for a win32 path of ~C:\Users\fred~ you
   would actually use ~/C:/Users/fred~. If your win32 server does not support
   the 'nix' path convention, you can try setting the ~remotePathSep~ property
   of the ~SftpClient~ object to the path separator of your remote server. This
   *might* work, but has not been tested. Please let me know if you need to do
   this and provide details of the SFTP server so that I can try to create an
   appropriate environment and adjust things as necessary. At this point, I'm
   not aware of any win32 based SFTP servers which do not support the 'nix' path
   convention.

   All remote paths must either be absolute e.g. ~/absolute/path/to/file~ or
   they can be relative with a prefix of either ~./~ (relative to current remote
   directory) or ~../~ (relative to parent of current remote directory) e.g.
   ~./relative/path/to/file~ or ~../relative/to/parent/file~. It is also
   possible to do things like ~../../../file~ to specify the parent of the
   parent of the parent of the current remote directory. The shell tilde (~~~)
   and common environment variables like ~$HOME~ are NOT supported.

   It is important to recognise that the current remote directory may not always
   be what you may expect. A lot will depend on the remote platform of the SFTP
   server and how the SFTP server has been configured. When things don't seem to
   be working as expected, it is often a good idea to verify your assumptions
   regarding the remote directory and remote paths. One way to do this is to
   login using a command line program like ~sftp~ or ~lftp~.

   There is a small performance hit for using ~./~ and ~../~ as the module must
   query the remote server to determine what the root path is and derive the
   absolute path. Using absolute paths are therefore more efficient and likely
   more robust.

   When specifying file paths, ensure to include a full path i.e. include the
   remote filename. Don't expect the module to append the local file name to the
   path you provide. For example, the following will not work

   #+begin_src javascript
     client.put('/home/fred/test.txt', '/remote/dir');
   #+end_src

   will not result in the file ~test.txt~ being copied to
   ~/remote/dir/test.txt~. You need to specify the target filename as well e.g.

   #+begin_src javascript
     client.put('/home/fred/test.txt', '/remote/dir/test.txt');
   #+end_src

   Note that the remote file name does not have to be the same as the local file
   name. The following works fine;

   #+begin_src javascript
     client.put('/home/fred/test.txt', '/remote/dir/test-copy.txt');
   #+end_src

   This will copy the local file ~test.txt~ to the remote file ~test-copy.txt~
   in the directory ~/remote/dir~.

** Methods

*** new SftpClient(name) ===> SFTP client object

Constructor to create a new ~ssh2-sftp-client~ object. An optional ~name~ string
can be provided, which will be used in error messages to help identify which
client has thrown the error.

**** Constructor Arguments

- name :: string. An optional name string used in error messages

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  'use strict';

  const Client = require('ssh2-sftp-client');

  const config = {
    host: 'example.com',
    username: 'donald',
    password: 'my-secret'
  };

  const sftp = new Client('example-client');

  sftp.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return sftp.cwd();
    })
    .then(p => {
      console.log(`Remote working directory is ${p}`);
      return sftp.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(`Error: ${err.message}`); // error message will include 'example-client'
    });
#+end_src

*** connect(config) ===> SFTPstream

Connect to an sftp server. Full documentation for connection options is
available [[https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2#user-content-client-methods][here]]

**** Connection Options

This module is based on the excellent [[https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2#client][SSH2]] module. That module is a general SSH2
client and server library and provides much more functionality than just SFTP
connectivity. Many of the connect options provided by that module are less
relevant for SFTP connections. It is recommended you keep the config options to
the minimum needed and stick to the options listed in the ~commonOpts~ below.

The ~retries~, ~retry_factor~ and ~retry_minTimeout~ options are not part of the
SSH2 module. These are part of the configuration for the [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/retry][retry]] package and what
is used to enable retrying of sftp connection attempts. See the documentation
for that package for an explanation of these values.

#+begin_src javascript
  // common options

  let commonOpts {
    host: 'localhost', // string Hostname or IP of server.
    port: 22, // Port number of the server.
    forceIPv4: false, // boolean (optional) Only connect via IPv4 address
    forceIPv6: false, // boolean (optional) Only connect via IPv6 address
    username: 'donald', // string Username for authentication.
    password: 'borsch', // string Password for password-based user authentication
    agent: process.env.SSH_AGENT, // string - Path to ssh-agent's UNIX socket
    privateKey: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/key'), // Buffer or string that contains
    passphrase: 'a pass phrase', // string - For an encrypted private key
    readyTimeout: 20000, // integer How long (in ms) to wait for the SSH handshake
    strictVendor: true // boolean - Performs a strict server vendor check
    debug: myDebug // function - Set this to a function that receives a single
                  // string argument to get detailed (local) debug information.
    retries: 2 // integer. Number of times to retry connecting
    retry_factor: 2 // integer. Time factor used to calculate time between retries
    retry_minTimeout: 2000 // integer. Minimum timeout between attempts
  };

  // rarely used options

  let advancedOpts {
    localAddress,
    localPort,
    hostHash,
    hostVerifier,
    agentForward,
    localHostname,
    localUsername,
    tryKeyboard,
    authHandler,
    keepaliveInterval,
    keepaliveCountMax,
    sock,
    algorithms,
    compress
  };
#+end_src

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  sftp.connect({
    host: example.com,
    port: 22,
    username: 'donald',
    password: 'youarefired'
  });
#+end_src

*** list(path, pattern) ==> Array[object]

Retrieves a directory listing. This method returns a Promise, which once
realised, returns an array of objects representing items in the remote
directory.

- path :: {String} Remote directory path
- pattern :: (optional) {string|RegExp} A pattern used to filter the items included in the returned
             array. Pattern can be a simple /glob/-style string or a regular
             expression. Defaults to ~/.*/~.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  const Client = require('ssh2-sftp-client');

  const config = {
    host: 'example.com',
    port: 22,
    username: 'red-don',
    password: 'my-secret'
  };

  let sftp = new Client;

  sftp.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return sftp.list('/path/to/remote/dir');
    })
    .then(data => {
      console.log(data);
    })
    .then(() => {
      sftp.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

**** Return Objects

The objects in the array returned by ~list()~ have the following properties;

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    type: // file type(-, d, l)
    name: // file name
    size: // file size
    modifyTime: // file timestamp of modified time
    accessTime: // file timestamp of access time
    rights: {
      user:
      group:
      other:
    },
    owner: // user ID
    group: // group ID
  }
#+end_src

**** Pattern Filter

The filter options can be a regular expression (most powerful option) or a
simple /glob/-like string where * will match any number of characters, e.g.

#+begin_example
  foo* => foo, foobar, foobaz
  ,*bar => bar, foobar, tabbar
  ,*oo* => foo, foobar, look, book
#+end_example

The /glob/-style matching is very simple. In most cases, you are best off using
a real regular expression which will allow you to do more powerful matching and
anchor matches to the beginning/end of the string etc.

*** exists(path) ==> boolean

Tests to see if remote file or directory exists. Returns type of remote object
if it exists or false if it does not.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  const Client = require('ssh2-sftp-client');

  const config = {
    host: 'example.com',
    port: 22,
    username: 'red-don',
    password: 'my-secret'
  };

  let sftp = new Client;

  sftp.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return sftp.exists('/path/to/remote/dir');
    })
    .then(data => {
      console.log(data);          // will be false or d, -, l (dir, file or link)
    })
    .then(() => {
      sftp.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** stat(path) ==> object

Returns the attributes associated with the object pointed to by ~path~.

- path :: String. Remote path to directory or file on remote server

**** Attributes

The ~stat()~ method returns an object with the following properties;

#+begin_src javascript
  let stats = {
    mode: 33279, // integer representing type and permissions
    uid: 1000, // user ID
    gid: 985, // group ID
    size: 5, // file size
    accessTime: 1566868566000, // Last access time. milliseconds
    modifyTime: 1566868566000, // last modify time. milliseconds
    isDirectory: false, // true if object is a directory
    isFile: true, // true if object is a file
    isBlockDevice: false, // true if object is a block device
    isCharacterDevice: false, // true if object is a character device
    isSymbolicLink: false, // true if object is a symbolic link
    isFIFO: false, // true if object is a FIFO
    isSocket: false // true if object is a socket
  };
#+end_src

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.stat('/path/to/remote/file');
    })
    .then(data => {
      // do something with data
    })
    .then(() => {
      client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** get(path, dst, options) ==> String|Stream|Buffer

Retrieve a file from a remote SFTP server. The ~dst~ argument defines the
destination and can be either a string, a stream object or undefined. If it is a
string, it is interpreted as the path to a location on the local file system
(path should include the file name). If it is a stream object, the remote data
is passed to it via a call to pipe(). If ~dst~ is undefined, the method will put
the data into a buffer and return that buffer when the Promise is resolved. If
~dst~ is defined, it is returned when the Promise is resolved.

In general, if your going to pass in a string as the destination, you are
better off using the ~fastGet()~ method.

- path :: String. Path to the remote file to download
- dst :: String|Stream. Destination for the data. If a string, it
         should be a local file path.
- options :: Options for the ~get()~ command (see below).

**** Options

The ~options~ argument can be used to pass options to the underlying streams and
pipe call used by this method. The argument is an object with three possible
properties, ~readStreamOptions~, ~writeStreamOptions~ and ~pipeOptions~. The
values for each of these properties should be an object containing the required
options. For example, possible read stream and pipe options could be defined as

#+begin_src javascript
  let options = {
    readStreamOptions: {
      flags: 'r',
      encoding: null,
      handle: null,
      mode: 0o666,
      autoClose: true
    },
    pipeOptions: {
      end: false
    }};
  
#+end_src

Most of the time, you won't want to use any options. Sometimes, it may be useful
to set the encoding. For example, to 'utf-8'. However, it is important not to do
this for binary files to avoid data corruption. 

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let client = new Client();

  let remotePath = '/remote/server/path/file.txt';
  let dst = fs.createWriteStream('/local/file/path/copy.txt');

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.get(remotePath, dst);
    })
    .then(() => {
      client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

- Tip :: See examples file in the Git repository for more examples. You can pass
         any writeable stream in as the destination. For example, if you pass in
         ~zlib.createGunzip()~ writeable stream, you can both download and
         decompress a gzip file 'on the fly'.

*** fastGet(remotePath, localPath, options) ===> string

Downloads a file at remotePath to localPath using parallel reads for faster
throughput. This is the simplest method if you just want to download a file.

- remotePath :: String. Path to the remote file to download
- localPath :: String. Path on local file system for the downloaded file. The
               local path should include the filename to use for saving the
               file.
- options :: Options for ~fastGet()~ (see below)

**** Options

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    concurrency: 64, // integer. Number of concurrent reads to use
    chunkSize: 32768, // integer. Size of each read in bytes
    step: function(total_transferred, chunk, total) // callback called each time a
                                                    // chunk is transferred
  }
#+end_src

- Warning :: Some servers do not respond correctly to requests to alter chunk
             size. This can result in lost or corrupted data.

**** Sample Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let client = new Client();
  let remotePath = '/server/path/file.txt';
  let localPath = '/local/path/file.txt';

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      client.fastGet(remotePath, localPath);
    })
    .then(() => {
      client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** put(src, remotePath, options) ==> string

Upload data from local system to remote server. If the ~src~ argument is a
string, it is interpreted as a local file path to be used for the data to
transfer. If the ~src~ argument is a buffer, the contents of the buffer are
copied to the remote file and if it is a readable stream, the contents of that
stream are piped to the ~remotePath~ on the server.

- src :: string | buffer | readable stream. Data source for data to copy to the
         remote server.
- remotePath :: string. Path to the remote file to be created on the server.
- options :: object. Options which can be passed to adjust the read and write stream used
             in sending the data to the remote server or the pipe call used to
             make the data transfer (see below).

**** Options

The options object supports three properties, ~readStreamOptions~,
~writeStreamOptions~ and ~pipeOptions~. The value for each property should be an
object with options as properties and their associated values representing the
option value. For example, you might use the following to set ~writeStream~ options.

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    writeStreamOptions: {
      flags: 'w',  // w - write and a - append
      encoding: null, // use null for binary files
      mode: 0o666, // mode to use for created file (rwx)
      autoClose: true // automatically close the write stream when finished
  }}
#+end_src

The most common options to use are mode and encoding. The values shown above are
the defaults. You do not have to set encoding to utf-8 for text files, null is
fine for all file types. However, using utf-8 encoding for binary files will
often result in data corruption.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let client = new Client();

  let data = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/local/file.txt');
  let remote = '/path/to/remote/file.txt';

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.put(data, remote);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

- Tip :: If the src argument is a path string, consider just using ~fastPut()~.

*** fastPut(localPath, remotePath, options) ==> string

Uploads the data in file at ~localPath~ to a new file on remote server at
~remotePath~ using concurrency. The options object allows tweaking of the fast put process.

- localPath :: string. Path to local file to upload
- remotePath :: string. Path to remote file to create
- options :: object. Options passed to createWriteStream (see below)

**** Options

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    concurrency: 64, // integer. Number of concurrent reads
    chunkSize: 32768, // integer. Size of each read in bytes
    mode: 0o755, // mixed. Integer or string representing the file mode to set
    step: function(total_transferred, chunk, total) // function. Called every time
    // a part of a file was transferred
  }
#+end_src

- Warning :: There have been reports that some SFTP servers will not honour
             requests for non-default chunk sizes. This can result in data loss
             or corruption.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let localFile = '/path/to/file.txt';
  let remoteFile = '/path/to/remote/file.txt';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      client.fastPut(localFile, remoteFile);
    })
    .then(() => {
      client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** append(input, remotePath, options) ==> string

Append the ~input~ data to an existing remote file. There is no integrity
checking performed apart from normal writeStream checks. This function simply
opens a writeStream on the remote file in append mode and writes the data passed
in to the file.

- input :: buffer | readStream. Data to append to remote file
- remotePath :: string. Path to remote file
- options :: object. Options to pass to writeStream (see below)

**** Options

The following options are supported;

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    flags: 'a',  // w - write and a - append
    encoding: null, // use null for binary files
    mode: 0o666, // mode to use for created file (rwx)
    autoClose: true // automatically close the write stream when finished
  }
#+end_src

The most common options to use are mode and encoding. The values shown above are
the defaults. You do not have to set encoding to utf-8 for text files, null is
fine for all file types. Generally, I would not attempt to append binary files.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let remotePath = '/path/to/remote/file.txt';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.append(Buffer.from('Hello world'), remotePath);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** mkdir(path, recursive) ==> string

Create a new directory. If the recursive flag is set to true, the method will
create any directories in the path which do not already exist. Recursive flag
defaults to false.

- path :: string. Path to remote directory to create
- recursive :: boolean. If true, create any missing directories in the path as
               well

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let remoteDir = '/path/to/new/dir';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.mkdir(remoteDir, true);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** rmdir(path, recursive) ==> string

Remove a directory. If removing a directory and recursive flag is set to
~true~, the specified directory and all sub-directories and files will be
deleted. If set to false and the directory has sub-directories or files, the
action will fail.

- path :: string. Path to remote directory
- recursive :: boolean. If true, remove all files and directories in target
               directory. Defaults to false

*Note*: There has been at least one report that some SFTP servers will allow
non-empty directories to be removed even without the recursive flag being set to
true. While this is not standard behaviour, it is recommended that users verify
the behaviour of rmdir if there are plans to rely on the recursive flag to
prevent removal of non-empty directories.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let remoteDir = '/path/to/remote/dir';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.rmdir(remoteDir, true);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** delete(path, noErrorOK) ==> string

Delete a file on the remote server.

- path :: string. Path to remote file to be deleted.

- noErrorOK :: boolean. If true, no error is raised when you try to delete a
  non-existent file. Default is false.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let remoteFile = '/path/to/remote/file.txt';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.delete(remoteFile);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** rename(fromPath, toPath) ==> string

Rename a file or directory from ~fromPath~ to ~toPath~. You must have the
necessary permissions to modify the remote file.

- fromPath :: string. Path to existing file to be renamed
- toPath :: string. Path to new file existing file is to be renamed to. Should
  not already exist.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let from = '/remote/path/to/old.txt';
  let to = '/remote/path/to/new.txt';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.rename(from, to);
    })

*** posixRename(fromPath, toPath) ==> string

This method uses the openssh POSIX rename extension introduced in OpenSSH 4.8.
The advantage of this version of rename over standard SFTP rename is that it is
an atomic operation and will allow renaming a resource where the destination
name exists. The POSIX rename will also work on some filesystems which do not
support standard SFTP rename because they don't support the system hardlink()
call. The POSIX rename extension is available on all openSSH servers from 4.8
and some other implementations. This is an extension to the standard SFTP
protocol and therefore is not supported on all sSFTP servers.

- fromPath :: string. Path to existing file to be renamed.
- toPath :: string. Path for new name. If it already exists, it will be replaced
  by file specified in fromPath

#+begin_src javascript
  let from = '/remote/path/to/old.txt';
  let to = '/remote/path/to/new.txt';
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.posixRename(from, to);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** chmod(path, mode) ==> string

Change the mode (read, write or execute permissions) of a remote file or
directory.

- path :: string. Path to the remote file or directory
- mode :: octal. New mode to set for the remote file or directory

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let path = '/path/to/remote/file.txt';
  let newMode = 0o644;  // rw-r-r
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return client.chmod(path, newMode);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** realPath(path) ===> string

Converts a relative path to an absolute path on the remote server. This method
is mainly used internally to resolve remote path names.

*Warning*: Currently, there is a platform inconsistency with this method on
win32 platforms. For servers running on non-win32 platforms, providing a path
which does not exist on the remote server will result in an empty e.g. '',
absolute path being returned. On servers running on win32 platforms, a
normalised path will be returned even if the path does not exist on the remote
server. It is therefore advised not to use this method to also verify a path
exists. instead, use the ~exist()~ method.

- path :: A file path, either relative or absolute. Can handle '.' and '..', but
  does not expand '~'.

*** cwd() ==> string

Returns what the server believes is the current remote working directory.

*** uploadDir(srcDir, dstDir, filter) ==> string

Upload the directory specified by ~srcDir~ to the remote directory specified by
~dstDir~. The ~dstDir~ will be created if necessary. Any sub directories within
~srcDir~ will also be uploaded. Any existing files in the remote path will be
overwritten.

The upload process also emits 'upload' events. These events are fired for each
successfully uploaded file. The ~upload~ event calls listeners with 1 argument,
an object which has properties source and destination. The source property is
the path of the file uploaded and the destination property is the path to where
the file was uploaded to. The purpose of this event is to provide some way for
client code to get feedback on the upload progress. You can add your own lisener
using the ~on()~ method.

The optionsl /filter/ argument is a regular expression which can be used to
select which files and directories to include in the upload.

- srcDir :: A local file path specified as a string
- dstDir :: A remote file path specified as a string
- filter :: A regular expression used to filter which files and directories to
  include in the upload

**** Example

     #+begin_src javascript
       'use strict';

       // Example of using the uploadDir() method to upload a directory
       // to a remote SFTP server

       const path = require('path');
       const SftpClient = require('../src/index');

       const dotenvPath = path.join(__dirname, '..', '.env');
       require('dotenv').config({path: dotenvPath});

       const config = {
   host: process.env.SFTP_SERVER,
   username: process.env.SFTP_USER,
   password: process.env.SFTP_PASSWORD,
   port: process.env.SFTP_PORT || 22
       };

       async function main() {
   const client = new SftpClient('upload-test');
   const src = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'test', 'testData', 'upload-src');
   const dst = '/home/tim/upload-test';

   try {
     await client.connect(config);
     client.on('upload', info => {
       console.log(`Listener: Uploaded ${info.source}`);
     });
     let rslt = await client.uploadDir(src, dst);
     return rslt;
   } finally {
     client.end();
   }
       }

       main()
   .then(msg => {
     console.log(msg);
   })
   .catch(err => {
     console.log(`main error: ${err.message}`);
   });

     #+end_src

*** downloadDir(srcDir, dstDir, filter) ==> string

Download the remote directory specified by ~srcDir~ to the local file system
directory specified by ~dstDir~. The ~dstDir~ directory will be created if
required. All sub directories within ~srcDir~ will also be copied. Any existing
files in the local path will be overwritten. No files in the local path will be
deleted.

The method also emites ~download~ events to provide a way to monitor download
progress. The download event listener is called with one argument, an object
with two properties, source and destination. The source property is the path to
the remote file that has been downloaded and the destination is the local path
to where the file was downloaded to. You can add a listener for this event using
the ~on()~ method.

The optional /filter/ argument is a regular expression which can be used to
select which files and directories will be downloaded from the remote server.

- srcDir :: A remote file path specified as a string
- dstDir :: A local file path specified as a string
- filter :: A regular expression used to match the files and directories to be
  downloaded

**** Example

#+begin_src javascript
  'use strict';

  // Example of using the downloadDir() method to upload a directory
  // to a remote SFTP server

  const path = require('path');
  const SftpClient = require('../src/index');

  const dotenvPath = path.join(__dirname, '..', '.env');
  require('dotenv').config({path: dotenvPath});

  const config = {
    host: process.env.SFTP_SERVER,
    username: process.env.SFTP_USER,
    password: process.env.SFTP_PASSWORD,
    port: process.env.SFTP_PORT || 22
  };

  async function main() {
    const client = new SftpClient('upload-test');
    const dst = '/tmp';
    const src = '/home/tim/upload-test';

    try {
      await client.connect(config);
      client.on('download', info => {
  console.log(`Listener: Download ${info.source}`);
      });
      let rslt = await client.downloadDir(src, dst);
      return rslt;
    } finally {
      client.end();
    }
  }

  main()
    .then(msg => {
      console.log(msg);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(`main error: ${err.message}`);
    });

#+end_src

*** end() ==> boolean

Ends the current client session, releasing the client socket and associated
resources. This function also removes all listeners associated with the client.

**** Example Use

#+begin_src javascript
  let client = new Client();

  client.connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      // do some sftp stuff
    })
    .then(() => {
      return client.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });
#+end_src

*** Add and Remove Listeners

Although normally not required, you can add and remove custom listeners on the
ssh2 client object. This object supports a number of events, but only a few of
them have any meaning in the context of SFTP. These are

- error :: An error occurred. Calls listener with an error argument.
- end :: The socket has been disconnected. No argument.
- close :: The socket was closed. Boolean argument which is true when the socket
           was closed due to errors.

**** on(eventType, listener)

Adds the specified listener to the specified event type. It the event type is
~error~, the listener should accept 1 argument, which will be an Error object. If
the event type is ~close~, the listener should accept one argument of a boolean
type, which will be true when the client connection was closed due to errors.

**** removeListener(eventType, listener)

Removes the specified listener from the event specified in eventType. Note that
the ~end()~ method automatically removes all listeners from the client object.

* Platform Quirks & Warnings
** Server Capabilities

   All SFTP servers and platforms are not equal. Some facilities provided by
   ~ssh2-sftp-client~ either depend on capabilities of the remote server or the
   underlying capabilities of the remote server platform. As an example,
   consider ~chmod()~. This command depends on a remote filesystem which
   implements the 'nix' concept of users and groups. The /win32/ platform does
   not have the same concept of users and groups, so ~chmod()~ will not behave
   in the same way.

   One way to determine whether an issue you are encountering is due to
   ~ssh2-sftp-client~ or due to the remote server or server platform is to use a
   simple CLI sftp program, such as openSSH's sftp command. If you observe the
   same behaviour using plain ~sftp~ on the command line, the issue is likely
   due to server or remote platform limitations. Note that you should not use a
   GUI sftp client, like ~Filezilla~ or ~winSCP~ as such GUI programs often
   attempt to hide these server and platform incompatibilities and will take
   additional steps to simulate missing functionality etc. You want to use a CLI
   program which does as little as possible.

** Promises & Events

   The reality of the current Node environment is that Promises and Events don't
   play nicely together. Part of the problem is that events are asynchronous in
   nature and can occur at any time. It is very difficult to ensure an event is
   captured inside a Promise and handled appropriately. More information can be
   found in the Node documentation for Events.

   Node v12 has introduced some experimental features to make working with
   Events and Promises a little easier. At this stage, we are not using these
   features because they are experimental and because it would mean you cannot
   use this module with Node v10. Use of these features will likely be examined
   more closely once they become stable and non-experimental.

   So, what does this mean for this module? The ~ssh2-sftp-client~ module works
   hard to ensure things work as expected. In most cases, events are handled
   appropriately. However, there are some edge cases where events may not be
   handled and you may see an uncaught error exception. The most common place to
   see this is when you keep an SFTP connection open, but don't use it for some
   time. When the connection is open, but no methods are active (running), there
   are no error handlers defined. Should an error event be emitted (for exmaple,
   because the network connection has been lost), there is no handler and you
   will get an uncaught error exception.

   One way to handle this is to add your own error handler using the on()
   method. Note however, you need to be careful how many times your error
   handler is added. If you begin to see a warning about a possible memory leak,
   it is an indication your error handler is being added multiple times (Node
   will generate this warning if it finds more than 11 listeners attached to an
   event emitter).

   The other issue that can occur is that in some rare cases, the error message
   you get will be potentially misleading. For example, SFTP servers running on
   Windows appear to emit an /ECONNRESET/ error in addition to the main error
   (for example, for failed authentication). This can result in an error which
   looks like a connection was reset by the remote host when in fact the real
   error was due to bad authentication (bad password or bad username). This
   situation can be made even worse by some platforms which deliberately hide
   the real error for security reasons e.g. does not report an error indicating
   a bad username because that information can be used to try and identify
   legitimate usernames. While this module attempts to provide meaningful error
   messages which can assist developers track down problems, it is a good idea
   to consider these errors with a grain of salt and verify the error when
   possible.

** Windows Based Servers

   It appears that when the sftp server is running on Windows, a /ECONNRESET/
   error signal is raised when the end() method is called. Unfortunately, this
   signal is raised after a considerable delay. This means we cannot remove the
   error handler used in the end() promise as otherwise you will get an uncaught
   exception error. Leaving the handler in place, even though we will ignore
   this error, solves that issue, but unfortunately introduces a new problem.
   Because we are not removing the listener, if you re-use the client object for
   subsequent connections, an additional error handler will be added. If this
   happens more than 11 times, you will eventually see the Node warning about a
   possible memory leak. This is because node monitors the number of error
   handlers and if it sees more than 11 added to an object, it assumes there is
   a problem and generates the warning.

   The best way to avoid this issue is to not re-use client objects. Always
   generate a new sftp client object for each new connection.

** Don't Re-use SftpClient Objects

   Due to an issue with /ECONNRESET/ error signals when connecting to Windows
   based SFTP servers, it is not possible to remove the error handler in the
   end() method. This means that if you re-use the SftpClient object for
   multiple connections e.g. calling connect(), then end(), then connect() etc,
   you run the risk of multiple error handlers being added to the SftpClient
   object. After 11 handlers have been added, Node will generate a possible
   memory leak warning.

   To avoid this problem, don't re-use SftpClient objects. Generate a new
   SftpClient object for each connection. You can perform multiple actions with
   a single connection e.g. upload multiple files, download multiple files etc,
   but after you have called end(), you should not try to re-use the object with
   a further connect() call. Create a new object instead.

* FAQ

** Remote server drops connections with only an end event

Many SFTP servers have rate limiting protection which will drop connections once
a limit has been reached. In particular, openSSH has the setting ~MaxStartups~,
which can be a tuple of the form =max:drop:full= where =max= is the maximum
allowed unauthenticated connections, =drop= is a percentage value which
specifies percentage of connections to be dropped once =max= connections has
been reached and =full= is the number of connections at which point all
subsequent connections will be dropped. e.g. =10:30:60= means allow up to 10
unauthenticated connections after which drop 30% of connection attempts until
reaching 60 unauthenticated connections, at which time, drop all attempts.

Clients first make an unauthenticated connection to the SFTP server to begin
negotiation of protocol settings (cipher, authentication method etc). If you are
creating multiple connections in a script, it is easy to exceed the limit,
resulting in some connections being dropped. As SSH2 only raises an 'end' event
for these dropped connections, no error is detected. The ~ssh2-sftp-client~ now
listens for ~end~ events during the connection process and if one is detected,
will reject the connection promise.

One way to avoid this type of issue is to add a delay between connection
attempts. It does not need to be a very long delay - just sufficient to permit
the previous connection to be authenticated. In fact, the default setting for
openSSH is =10:30:60=, so you really just need to have enough delay to ensure
that the 1st connection has completed authentication before the 11th connection
is attempted.

** How can I pass writable stream as dst for get method?

If the dst argument passed to the get method is a writeable stream, the remote
file will be piped into that writeable. If the writeable you pass in is a
writeable stream created with ~fs.createWriteStream()~, the data will be written
to the file specified in the constructor call to ~createWriteStream()~.

The writeable stream can be any type of write stream. For example, the below code
will convert all the characters in the remote file to upper case before it is
saved to the local file system. This could just as easily be something like a
gunzip stream from ~zlib~, enabling you to decompress remote zipped files as you
bring them across before saving to local file system.

#+begin_src javascript
  'use strict';

  // Example of using a writeable with get to retrieve a file.
  // This code will read the remote file, convert all characters to upper case
  // and then save it to a local file

  const Client = require('../src/index.js');
  const path = require('path');
  const fs = require('fs');
  const through = require('through2');

  const config = {
    host: 'arch-vbox',
    port: 22,
    username: 'tim',
    password: 'xxxx'
  };

  const sftp = new Client();
  const remoteDir = '/home/tim/testServer';

  function toupper() {
    return through(function(buf, enc, next) {
      next(null, buf.toString().toUpperCase());
    });
  }

  sftp
    .connect(config)
    .then(() => {
      return sftp.list(remoteDir);
    })
    .then(data => {
      // list of files in testServer
      console.dir(data);
      let remoteFile = path.join(remoteDir, 'test.txt');
      let upperWtr = toupper();
      let fileWtr = fs.createWriteStream(path.join(__dirname, 'loud-text.txt'));
      upperWtr.pipe(fileWtr);
      return sftp.get(remoteFile, upperWtr);
    })
    .then(() => {
      return sftp.end();
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.error(err.message);
    });

** How can I upload files without having to specify a password?

There are a couple of ways to do this. Essentially, you want to setup SSH keys
and use these for authentication to the remote server.

One solution, provided by @KalleVuorjoki is to use the SSH agent
process. *Note*: SSH_AUTH_SOCK is normally created by your OS when you load the
ssh-agent as part of the login session.

#+begin_src javascript
  let sftp = new Client();
  sftp.connect({
    host: 'YOUR-HOST',
    port: 'YOUR-PORT',
    username: 'YOUR-USERNAME',
    agent: process.env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK
  }).then(() => {
    sftp.fastPut(/* ... */)
  }
#+end_src

Another alternative is to just pass in the SSH key directly as part of the
configuration.

#+begin_src javascript
  let sftp = new Client();
  sftp.connect({
    host: 'YOUR-HOST',
    port: 'YOUR-PORT',
    username: 'YOUR-USERNAME',
    privateKey: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/ssh/key')
  }).then(() => {
    sftp.fastPut(/* ... */)
  }
#+end_src

** How can I connect through a Socks Proxy

This solution was provided by @jmorino.

#+begin_src javascript
  import { SocksClient } from 'socks';
  import SFTPClient from 'ssh2-sftp-client';

  const host = 'my-sftp-server.net';
  const port = 22; // default SSH/SFTP port on remote server

  // connect to SOCKS 5 proxy
  const { socket } = await SocksClient.createConnection({
    proxy: {
      host: 'my.proxy', // proxy hostname
      port: 1080, // proxy port
      type: 5, // for SOCKS v5
    },
    command: 'connect',
    destination: { host, port } // the remote SFTP server
  });

  const client = new SFTPClient();
  client.connect({
    host,
    sock: socket, // pass the socket to proxy here (see ssh2 doc)
    username: '.....',
    privateKey: '.....'
  })

  // client is connected
#+end_src

** Timeout while waiting for handshake or handshake errors

Some users have encountered the error 'Timeout while waiting for handshake' or
'Handshake failed, no matching client->server ciphers. This is often due to the
client not having the correct configuration for the transport layer algorithms
used by ssh2. One of the connect options provided by the ssh2 module is
~algorithm~, which is an object that allows you to explicitly set the key
exchange, ciphers, hmac and compression algorithms as well as server
host key used to establish the initial secure connection. See the SSH2
documentation for details. Getting these parameters correct usually resolves the
issue.

** How can I limit upload/download speed

   If you want to limit the amount of bandwidth used during upload/download of
   data, you can use a stream to limit throughput. The following example was
   provided by /kennylbj/. Note that there is a caveat that we must set the
   ~autoClose~ flag to false to avoid calling an extra ~_read()~ on a closed stream
   that may cause _get Permission Denied error in ssh2-streams.


   #+begin_src javascript


     const Throttle = require('throttle');
     const progress = require('progress-stream');

     // limit download speed
     const throttleStream = new Throttle(config.throttle);

     // download progress stream
     const progressStream = progress({
       length: fileSize,
       time: 500,
     });
     progressStream.on('progress', (progress) => {
       console.log(progress.percentage.toFixed(2));
     });

     const outStream = createWriteStream(localPath);

     // pipe streams together
     throttleStream.pipe(progressStream).pipe(outStream);

     try {
       // set autoClose to false
       await client.get(remotePath, throttleStream, { autoClose: false });
     } catch (e) {
       console.log('sftp error', e);
     } finally {
       await client.end();
     }

* Examples

I have started collecting example scripts in the example directory of the
repository. These are mainly scripts I have put together in order to investigate
issues or provide samples for users. They are not robust, lack adequate error
handling and may contain errors. However, I think they are still useful for
helping developers see how the module and API can be used.

* Troubleshooting

The ~ssh2-sftp-client~ module is essentially a wrapper around the ~ssh2~ and
~ssh2-streams~ modules, providing a higher level ~promise~ based API. When you
run into issues, it is important to try and determine where the issue lies -
either in the ssh2-sftp-client module or the underlying ~ssh2~ and
~ssh2-streams~ modules. One way to do this is to first identify a minimal
reproducible example which reproduces the issue. Once you have that, try to
replicate the functionality just using the ~ssh2~ and ~ssh2-streams~ modules. If
the issue still occurs, then you can be fairly confident it is something related
to those later 2 modules and therefore and issue which should be referred to the
maintainer of that module.

The ~ssh2~ and ~ssh2-streams~ modules are very solid, high quality modules with
a large user base. Most of the time, issues with those modules are due to client
misconfiguration. It is therefore very important when trying to diagnose an
issue to also check the documentation for both ~ssh2~ and ~ssh2-streams~. While
these modules have good defaults, the flexibility of the ssh2 protocol means
that not all options are available by default. You may need to tweak the
connection options, ssh2 algorithms and ciphers etc for some remote servers. The
documentation for both the ~ssh2~ and ~ssh2-streams~ module is quite
comprehensive and there is lots of valuable information in the issue logs.

If you run into an issue which is not repeatable with just the ~ssh2~ and
~ssh2-streams~ modules, then please log an issue against the ~ssh2-sftp-client~
module and I will investigate. Please note the next section on logging issues.

Note also that in the repository there are two useful directories. The first is
the examples directory, which contain some examples of using ~ssh2-sftp-client~
to perform common tasks. A few minutes reviewing these examples can provide that
additional bit of detail to help fix any problems you are encountering.

The second directory is the validation directory. I have some very simple
scripts in this directory which perform basic tasks using only the ~ssh2~
modules (no ~ssh2-sftp-client~ module). These can be useful when
trying to determine if the issue is with the underlying ~ssh2~ module or
the ~ssh2-sftp-client~ wrapper module.

** Common Errors

   There are some common errors people tend to make when using Promises or
   Asyc/Await. These are by far the most common problem found in issues logged
   against this module. Please check for some of these before logging your
   issue.

*** Not returning the promise in a ~then()~ block

    All methods in ~ssh2-sftp-client~ return a Promise. This means methods are
    executed /asynchrnously/. When you call a method inside the ~then()~ block
    of a promise chain, it is critical that you return the Promise that call
    generates. Failing to do this will result in the ~then()~ block completing
    and your code starting execution of the next ~then()~, ~catch()~ or
    ~finally()~ block before your promise has been fulfilled. For example, the
    following will not do what you expect

    #+begin_src javascript
      sftp.connect(config)
        .then(() => {
          sftp.fastGet('foo.txt', 'bar.txt');
        }).then(rslt => {
          console.log(rslt);
          sftp.end();
        }).catch(e => {
          console.error(e.message);
        });
    #+end_src

    In the above code, the ~sftp.end()~ method will almost certainly be called
    before ~sftp.fastGet()~ has been fulfilled (unless the /foo.txt/ file is
    really small!). In fact, the whole promise chain will complete and exit even
    before the ~sftp.end()~ call has been fulfilled. The correct code would be
    something like

    #+begin_src javascript
      sftp.connect(config)
        .then(() => {
          return sftp.fastGet('foo.txt', 'bar.txt');
        }).then(rslt => {
          console.log(rslt);
          return sftp.end();
        }).catch(e => {
          console.error(e.message);
        });
    #+end_src

    Note the ~return~ statements. These ensure that the Promise returned by the
    client method is returned into the promise chain. It will be this promise
    the next block in the chain will wait on to be fulfilled before the next
    block is executed. Without the return statement, that block will return the
    default promise for that block, which essentially says /this block has been
    fulfilled/. What you really want is the promise which says /your sftp client
    method call has been fulfilled/.

    A common symptom of this type of error is for file uploads or download to
    fail to complete or for data in those files to be truncated. What is
    happening is that the connection is being ended before the transfer has
    completed.

*** Mixing Promise Chains and Async/Await

    Another common error is to mix Promise chains and async/await calls. This is
    rarely a great idea. While you can do this, it tends to create complicated
    and difficult to maintain code. Select one approach and stick with it. Both
    approaches are functionally equivalent, so there is no reason to mix up the
    two paradigms. My personal preference would be to use async/await as I think
    that is more /natural/ for most developers. For example, the following is
    more complex and difficult to follow than necessary (and has a bug!)

    #+begin_src javascript
      sftp.connect(config)
        .then(() => {
          return sftp.cwd();
        }).then(async (d) => {
          console.log(`Remote directory is ${d}`);
          try {
            await sftp.fastGet(`${d}/foo.txt`, `./bar.txt`);
          }.catch(e => {
            console.error(e.message);
          });
        }).catch(e => {
          console.error(e.message);
        }).finally(() => {
          sftp.end();
        });
    #+end_src

    The main bug in the above code is the ~then()~ block is not returning the
    Promise generated by the call to ~sftp.fastGet()~. What it is actually
    returning is a fulfilled promise which says the ~then()~ block has been run
    (note that the await'ed promise is not being returned and is therefore
    outside the main Promise chain). As a result, the ~finally()~ block will be
    executed before the await promise has been fulfilled.

    Using async/await inside the promise chain has created unnecessary
    complexity and leads to incorrect assumptions regarding how the code will
    execute. A quick glance at the code is likely to give the impression that
    execution will wait for the ~sftp.fastGet()~ call to be fulfilled before
    continuing. This is not the case. The code would be more clearly expressed
    as either

    #+begin_src javascript
      sftp.connect(config)
        .then(() => {
          return sftp.cwd();
        }).then(d => {
          console.log(`remote dir ${d}`);
          return sftp.fastGet(`${d}/foot.txt`, 'bar.txt');
        }).catch(e => {
          console.error(e.message);
        }).finally(() => {
          return sftp.end();
        });
    #+end_src

   *or, using async/await*

   #+begin_src javascript
     async function doSftp() {
       try {
         let sftp = await sftp.connect(conf);
         let d = await sftp.cwd();
         console.log(`remote dir is ${d}`);
         await sftp.fastGet(`${d}/foo.txt`, 'bat.txt');
       } catch (e) {
         console.error(e.message);
       } finally () {
         await sftp.end();
       }
     }
   #+end_src

*** Try/catch and Error Handlers

    Another common error is to try and use a try/catch block to catch event
    signals, such as an error event. In general, you cannot use try/catch blocks
    for asynchronous code and expect errors to be caught by the ~catch~ block.
    Handling errors in asynchronous code is one of the key reasons we now have
    the Promise and async/await frameworks.

    The basic problem is that the try/catch block will have completed execution
    before the asynchronous code has completed. If the asynchronous code has not
    compleed, then there is a potential for it to raise an error. However, as
    the try/catch block has already completed, there is no /catch/ waiting to
    catch the error. It will bubble up and probably result in your script
    exiting with an uncaught exception error.

    Error events are essentially asynchronous code. You don't know when such
    events will fire. Therefore, you cannot use a try/catch block to catch such
    event errors. Even creating an error handler which then throws an exception
    won't help as the key problem is that your try/catch block has already
    executed. There are a number of alternative ways to deal with this
    situation. However, the key symptom is that you see occasional uncaught
    error exceptions that cause your script to exit abnormally despite having
    try/catch blocks in your script. What you need to do is look at your code
    and find where errors are raised asynchronously and use an event handler or
    some other mechanism to manage any errors raised.

*** Server Differences

    Not all SFTP servers are the same. Like most standards, the SFTP protocol
    has some level of interpretation and allows different levels of compliance.
    This means there can be differences in behaviour between different servers
    and code which works with one server will not work the same with another.
    For example, the value returned by /realpath/ for non-existent objects can
    differ significantly. Some servers will throw an error for a particular
    operation while others will just return null, some servers support
    concurrent operations (such as used by fastGet/fastPut) while others will
    not and of course, the text of error messages can vary significantly. In
    particular, we have noticed significant differences across different
    platforms. It is therefore advisable to do comprehensive testing when the
    SFTP server is moved to a new platform. This includes moving from to a cloud
    based service even if the underlying platform remains the same. I have
    noticed that some cloud platforms can generate unexpected events, possibly
    related to additional functionality or features associated with the cloud
    implementation. For example, it appears SFTP servers running under Azure
    will generate an error event when the connection is closed even when the
    client has requested the connection be terminated. The same SFTP server
    running natively on Windows does not appear to exhibit such behaviour.

*** Avoid Concurrent Operations

    Technically, SFTP should be able to perform multiple operations
    concurrently. As node is single threaded, what we a really talking about is
    running multiple execution contexts as a pool where node will switch
    contexts when each context is blocked due to things like waiting on network
    data etc. However, I have found this to be extremely unreliable and of very
    little benefit from a performance perspective. My recommendation is to
    therefore avoid executing multiple requests over the same connection in
    parallel (for example, generating multiple ~get()~ promises and using
    something like ~Promise.all()~ to resolve them.

    If you are going to try and perform concurrent operations, you need to test
    extensively and ensure you are using data which is large enough that context
    switching does occur (i.e. the request is not completed in a single run).
    Some SFTP servers will handle concurrent operations better than others.

** Debugging Support

You can add a ~debug~ property to the config object passed in to ~connect()~ to
turn on debugging. This will generate quite a lot of output. The value of the
property should be a function which accepts a single string argument. For example;

#+begin_src javascript
  config.debug = msg => {
    console.error(msg);
  };

#+end_src

Enabling debugging can generate a lot of output. If you use console.error() as
the output (as in the example above), you can redirect the output to a file
using shell redirection e.g.

#+begin_src shell
  node script.js 2> debug.log

#+end_src

If you just want to see debug messages from ~ssh2-sftp-client~ and exclude debug
messages from the underlying ~ssh2~ and ~ssh2-streams~ modules, you can filter
based on messages which start with 'CLIENT' e.g.

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    debug: (msg) => {
      if (msg.startsWith('CLIENT')) {
        console.error(msg);
      }
    }
  }
#+end_src
* Logging Issues

Please log an issue for all bugs, questions, feature and enhancement
requests. Please ensure you include the module version, node version and
platform.

I am happy to try and help diagnose and fix any issues you encounter while using
the ~ssh2-sftp-client~ module. However, I will only put in effort if you are
prepared to put in the effort to provide the information necessary to reproduce
the issue. Things which will help

- Node version you are using
- Version of ssh2-sftp-client you are using
- Platform your client is running on (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Platform and software for the remote SFTP server when possible
- Example of your code or a minimal script which reproduces the issue you are
  encountering. By far, the most common issue is incorrect use of the module
  API. Example code can usually result in such issues being resolved very
  quickly.

Perhaps the best assistance is a minimal reproducible example of the issue. Once
the issue can be readily reproduced, it can usually be fixed very quickly.

Pull requests are always welcomed. However, please ensure your changes pass all
tests and if your adding a new feature, that tests for that feature are
included. Likewise, for new features or enhancements, please include any
relevant documentation updates.

This module will adopt a standard semantic versioning policy. Please indicate in
your pull request what level of change it represents i.e.

- Major :: Change to API or major change in functionality which will require an
           increase in major version number.
- Minor :: Minor change, enhancement or new feature which does not change
           existing API and will not break existing client code.
- Bug Fix :: No change to functionality or features. Simple fix of an existing
             bug.
